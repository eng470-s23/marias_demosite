# about this file
Based on the [UO library research guide on data management](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management) and UO's [Basic Accessibility Testing guidance](https://digitalaccessibility.uoregon.edu/assessment/basictesting).

This file is a collection of newspaper sections about women's participance in the work force in Oregon, which have been gathered from the University of Oregon's "Historic Oregon Newspapers" website.

# expected data and formats
*Data may originate from observations, experiments, or references; it may be derived from other sources, transformed, or the result of a simulation. Describe your data file formats. Whenever possible, [use non-proprietary formats](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/fileformats) or convert your data to open, shareable formats when archiving data. Remember: data also includes your code and workflow documentation!*

- Plain text saved and edited into txt files which I upload to text edit. 

# documentation and metadata
*Describe how you will [document your data](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/readme) as you gather it. Descriptions of your data (or metadata) can help you and others locate, understand, and interpret your data. Describe the applicable standards for metadata content and format that you will follow, including the procedures and tools/software you will use to capture and edit the metadata.*

- My naming convention for my files helps to describe the data I am using so that others can find it. I will edit my data with TextEdit and then upload it to Voyant, where it will be analyzed. 

# organization and storage
*Describe your [file naming convention and version control practices](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/filenaming). Describe [storage methods and backup procedures](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/backup) for the data, including physical and cyber resources and facilities (hard-disk space, backup server, repository). Describe how you will take into consideration privacy, security, intellectual property, and other rights.*

- I am using "nameofnewspaper.year.month.date_sectiontitle" for my files. My files will be saved in a folder on my desktop, as well as in text edit, and in google drive. I created a folder in google drive where I will upload my files at the end of the day each time I work on them. 

# sharing, publication, and archiving
*Describe what you will do to [provide others access to the data](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/archiving). Identify any restrictions on who may access the data and under what conditions and a timeline for providing access. Also describe your plans for preserving data, outlining any changes in access anticipated during the preservation timeline, and documenting the resources and capabilities (e.g., equipment, connections, systems, expertise) needed to meet the preservation goals.*

- All of my data will be ulpoaded to Voyant, and analyzed, but I might make my data accessible through GitHUb so that others can look at the original texts that I have been working with. 

# accessibility
*Describe your plans for ensuring that your data and project outputs are accessible for users with disabilities. Basic accessibility features include the use of alternative text for images; captions and transcripts for videos; large, easy-to-read fonts; high-contrast color schemes; text content broken up logically with section headers and lists; and links embedded [in context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context.html) rather than on phrases like [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Be specific about how you will implement accessibility features that are relevant to your data.*

- To make this data accessible, I will use large fonts with contrasting colors that are not difficult to read against one another, and will use a color pallette that is friendly for people who are colorblind.
