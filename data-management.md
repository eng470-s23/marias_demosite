# about this file

This file is a collection of newspaper sections about women's participance in the work force in Oregon, which have been gathered from the University of Oregon's "Historic Oregon Newspapers" website.

# expected data and formats

The expected formats of my data are digitized newspaper articles, I will save them as plain text files in order to process them using 'Text Edit', and then they will be saved as plain text files in a folder on my desktop. I will upload this data to GitHub so that it can easily be accessed by anyone who would like to look at it. 

# documentation and metadata

My naming convention for my files helps to describe the data I am using so that others can find it. I will document any changes made to these files, such as the conversion of older spellings of words into more modern spellings, in my project log on GitHub. I will edit my data with TextEdit and then upload it to Voyant, where it will be analyzed, and I will document stopwords used in Voyant on my project log On GitHub. 

# organization and storage

I am using "year.month.date_nameofnewspaper_sectiontitle" for my files. My files will be saved in a folder on my desktop, as well as on GitHub. I created a folder in google drive where I will upload my files at the end of the day each time I work on them. I originally began with the name of newspaper at the beginning, but found that as I wanted to sort them by date, this would not work. An example is "1912.02.25_thesundayoregonian_betterlawsforwomen.txt". Many of these file names can get pretty long as the titles can be long, but I would prefer for them to be longer and more specific. The papers through 1923 are available through the public domain, but will be cited, and those after 1923 I will cite and use a fair use assessment. I ended up organizing my data into an unsorted file, as well as sorted files to make them easier to analyze.

# sharing, publication, and archiving

All of my data will be uploaded to Voyant, and analyzed, but I will make my data accessible through GitHUb so that others can look at the files that I have processed and uploaded to Voyant. 

# accessibility

To make this data accessible, I will use large fonts with contrasting colors that are not difficult to read against one another, and will use a color pallette that is friendly for people who are colorblind. I will also use bold fonts, headers, and alt text in my static page.
