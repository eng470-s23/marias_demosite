# What's a White Paper?

In digital humanities, it is common for project teams to publish a report of funded development activities after a grant cycle is completed. The following template is taken from the [instructions provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/how-write-successful-white-paper-tips-odh) to recipients of Digital Humanities Advancement Grants.

## Project Summary 

Newspapers serve as primary sources and forms of media which can be revealing about the period in which they were written. 

Be sure to include access info for your project (or embedded content). - 1 paragraph

Begin with a brief 1-2 paragraph introduction that summarizes your project’s goals, outcomes, and primary collaborators. Include links to the project or institute website and any other key content available online.

You may wish to include a Table of Contents.

## Project Origins and Goals

This winter, I took History of the Pacific North West with Professor Steven Beda, and one of the books we read for this course was Sandy Polishuk's book *Sticking to the Union: An Oral History of the Life and Times of Julia Ruuttila*. Julia Ruutila was a labor activist in Oregon, and this book ended up being my inspiration for this project. I wanted to research labor histories in Oregon, but struggled to find a gap in existing research. Eventually while pursuing a different idea for this project, I read "Rejection, Reception, and Rejection Again: Women in Oregon’s World War II Shipyards" by Diane Simmons. The author was preparing to interview a family friend about her work in Portland's Shipyards during WW2 and looked at different newspapers that had been released around that time to get an idea for the way that people felt about women working in the Shipyards. After reading this article, I thought that it would be really interesting to a larger collection of texts occurring over a period of time to show how attitudes toward's women's participation in the work force, and how the types of work they participated in changed over time. In doing so, you can also see changes in  

It's very likely that elements of your pitch and/or environmental scan will be revised and incorporated here.

## Project Activities
team/participnats
The primary purpose of this section is to help readers understand how you did your project. This is particularly helpful for project managers looking for insight into project design. It’s also an opportunity to give credit to project participants.

[data](https://github.com/eng470-s23/marias_demosite/tree/main/data) as well as the sources 

Guiding questions:

What were the concrete activities that you did during your project or institute?
What was the timeline for those activities and how did it differ from what you originally proposed?
If you directed an institute, how did you recruit participants? If you directed a project, how did you build the project team and identify stakeholders?
What social, technical, or institutional challenges did you face that impacted your ability to implement your project or institute?
Who was involved in your project? What kinds of expertise did your project or institute require?
What challenges did you encounter relating to project management, collaboration, or labor that impacted your ability to implement your project or institute?

## Project Outcomes
The primary purpose of this section is to help readers understand what you did or created during the course of your project.

Guiding Questions:

What were the final products and outcomes at the end of the award (i.e. a series of workshops, an institute curriculum, a website, a piece of software, a workflow, a scholarly article, etc.)?
Who are the actual audiences of the project (how did that change from your application) and how did you reach them?
What technical decisions did you make during the design of your project? For example, what platform are you hosting your project on? What code libraries or packages did you build upon and where can others find them? How did you decide on metadata standards? How did you identify a repository system for the project’s digital assets?
Did you face any challenges relating to documentation, accessibility, access, language use, copyright, or privacy?
What personal or professional outcomes came from this project? For example, do you believe that your project helped members of your team to graduate, earn a promotion, get a job, or win additional grants?
Where should readers look for more information about your project or institute (include URLs, future publication plans, citations, et al)?  What about any software developed?  Is it available in a code repository?

## Project Continuation and Long-Term Impact
The primary purpose of this section is to help readers think about the future of this work.

Guiding questions:

Will you continue working on this project? Why or why not?
What are the next steps for your project or institute?
How do you plan to fund ongoing research?
