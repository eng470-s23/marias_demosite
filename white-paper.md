# What's a White Paper?

In digital humanities, it is common for project teams to publish a report of funded development activities after a grant cycle is completed. The following template is taken from the [instructions provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/how-write-successful-white-paper-tips-odh) to recipients of Digital Humanities Advancement Grants.

## Project Summary 

This winter, I took History of the Pacific North West with Professor Steven Beda, and one of the books we read for this course was Sandy Polishuk's book *Sticking to the Union: An Oral History of the Life and Times of Julia Ruuttila*. Julia Ruutila was a labor activist in Oregon, and this book ended up being my inspiration for this project.
