## Project Summary 

Using this project, I wanted to continue to learn about labor history in Oregon, as it is an area I haven't studied as much as some others, and I wanted to use primary sources as true snapshots in this project which would be revealing about the period in which they were written, and would change based on historical events that I was already familiar with. I felt that using newspapers to do this would be fitting, and as newspapers have become less prevalent with the advent of technology, I thought it would be interesting to see them immortalized and compared side by side using [my DH Capstone project](https://eng470-s23.github.io/marias_demosite/) to do so. The question that guided my research had to do with how Oregon Historical newspapers from around the state, including articles aboutcities around the world, reflect changing attitudes towards women’s participation in the workforce in Oregon from 1910-1975. I chose this period as I felt it was a period with an overarching theme of change, and encapsulated many different historical events which influenced labor patterns. The newspapers I analyzed in this project not only reflect the way that attitudes toward's women's participation in the work force changed, but they also reflect both racial and class dynamics, industrialization, and the influence of different historical events on attitudes.

## Project Origins and Goals

This winter, I took History of the Pacific North West with Professor Steven Beda, and one of the books we read for this course was Sandy Polishuk's book *Sticking to the Union: An Oral History of the Life and Times of Julia Ruuttila*. Julia Ruutila was a labor activist in Oregon, and this book ended up being my inspiration for this project. I wanted to research labor histories in Oregon, but struggled to find a gap in existing research. Eventually while pursuing a different idea for this project, I read "Rejection, Reception, and Rejection Again: Women in Oregon’s World War II Shipyards" by Diane Simmons. The author was preparing to interview a family friend about her work in Portland's Shipyards during WW2 and looked at different newspapers that had been released around that time to get an idea for the way that people felt about women working in the Shipyards. After reading this article, I thought that it would be really interesting to a larger collection of texts occurring over a period of time to show how attitudes toward's women's participation in the work force, and how the types of work they participated in changed over time. In doing so, you can also see changes in

## Project Activities

This project truly began around halfway through this term when I finally figured out what I wanted to do it about. I started reading a few different sources as background information, mostly just to help provide some more information about the papers that I would eventually start processing. As a history major, I already had an idea of different events that I would see in the papers I analyzed, but having a bit of extra information never hurts. We worked for class on different assignments all term that would build into this project, and I finally began processing papers a bit later than I should've but it was around the end of Week 7. I searched "women labor" in the Historic Oregon Newspapers site, and downloaded papers started in 1910 as plain text files and went through the original scans of these text files and edited the parts that were inaccurate, and removed irrelevent sections. As I mined and transcribed these newspapers, I made edits to some of them so that when they were eventually Uploaded to Voyant, there would'nt be multiple versions of different words.

- The changes I made were as follows:
    - per cent -> percent
    - tokether -> together
    - statees -> states
    - thru -> through
    - middle west -> midwest
    - asociation -> association
    - aeroplane(s) -> airplane(s)
    - till -> until
    - ocupation -> occupation
    - criticises -> criticizes
    - seceretary -> secretary
    - them selves -> themselves
    - well being -> well-being
    - manikin -> mannequin
    - calory -> calorie
    - decripit -> decrepit

I then removed the extra spacing that created columns, and saved them into a file with the naming convention: "year.month.day_newspapertitle_articletitle", an example: "1918.10.13_thesundayoregonian_wartimewomenfindmuchworktodo.txt". I uploaded these files into a [folder](https://github.com/eng470-s23/marias_demosite/tree/main/data) on Github. During this process, I kept track of the source [citations](/DH-Capstone-Sources.pdf) for the newspapers in a spreadsheet in Excel, and posted them to Github. During week 9, we made [presentations](/presentation.pdf) about our projects. I uploaded the data collected from the newspapers as a corpus to Voyant, 

I ran into a lot of problems throughout this project, and one of the biggest was how to use Voyant to encapsulate all of the different papers that I had seen. I looked at each and every one in detail, and it was difficult to find a way to use Voyant to truly represent each different paper without feeling like things were being left out.

Guiding questions:

What were the concrete activities that you did during your project or institute?
What was the timeline for those activities and how did it differ from what you originally proposed?

Guiding Questions:

What were the final products and outcomes at the end of the award (i.e. a series of workshops, an institute curriculum, a website, a piece of software, a workflow, a scholarly article, etc.)?
Who are the actual audiences of the project (how did that change from your application) and how did you reach them?
What technical decisions did you make during the design of your project? For example, what platform are you hosting your project on? What code libraries or packages did you build upon and where can others find them? How did you decide on metadata standards? How did you identify a repository system for the project’s digital assets?
Did you face any challenges relating to documentation, accessibility, access, language use, copyright, or privacy?
What personal or professional outcomes came from this project? For example, do you believe that your project helped members of your team to graduate, earn a promotion, get a job, or win additional grants?
Where should readers look for more information about your project or institute (include URLs, future publication plans, citations, et al)?  What about any software developed?  Is it available in a code repository?

## Project Continuation and Long-Term Impact
The primary purpose of this section is to help readers think about the future of this work.

I am graduating in just a few weeks and will be leaving the future of this project to the wonderful Mattie Burkert at the University of Oregon! I think that the future of this project could expand to include different key words searched, more years included, or including another state to reveal patterns about the PNW, or Washington and California, to include patterns about the West Coast, or even a state like New York and you could compare different states to see if they reflect similar patterns or not. I think that there are a lot of different directions that this project could go in in the future, all of which would be really interesting.

Guiding questions:

Will you continue working on this project? Why or why not?
What are the next steps for your project or institute?
How do you plan to fund ongoing research?
What new research questions does this project introduce? How would you like to see other researchers follow up on your project outcomes?
How will you maintain relationships beyond the end of your workshop, institute, or project?
