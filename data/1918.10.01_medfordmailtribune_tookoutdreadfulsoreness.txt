At a well attended meeting of citizens last night at the Commercial club the war labor community board for Medford was organized as follows: T. W. Miles to represent the government; Arthur L. Hill to represent the employers with J. H. Tomlin as alternate; Mrs. N. M. Stover to represent the employers for women; W. T. York to represent men labor; with IH. C.

The hoard was to meet late this afternoon with government representatives from Portland who would sanction the appointments and give instructions, following which the board was to organize.
