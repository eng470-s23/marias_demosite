SUFFRAGETTE ADMITS ARSON Also Claims She Blew Up Cotton  Exchange in London Liverpool—Mrs. Edith Rigby, mili-­ tant suffragette who has already been arrested and released on various occasions after undergoing hunger strikes, voluntarily gave herself up to The police and confessed dramatically  in court incendiarism.  Mrs. Rigby told of having burned Sir William H. Lever's $100,000 country residence at Rivington, near­ Horwich, Lancashire, as a "beacon lighted for the king and the country to see women suffering an insupportable grievance.” She also confessed to being the perpetrator of the dynamite outrage at the Liverpool Cotton Exchange July 5. "I placed the explosive in the stock exchange to show how easy it is to procure them and to place them in public buildings,” she said. "I might just as easily have blown up the Nelson monument. "I chose the Liver­pool Cotton Exchange because the cot-­ ton industry has been built largely by women’s labor. The merchants are willing to get power and wealth out of labor of women while the women themselves are denied the vote and citizenship. This is the first knock at door. Under the ‘cat and mouse’ act one of the greatest women in the land is going to be done to death. If the government is going to kill that woman, this is a warning.” Mrs. Rigby has been a member of the Women’s Social and Political Union, the militant suffragette organization, for many years, and has taken a great part in public movements to promote the welfare of women. She is the wife of a physician at Preston.
