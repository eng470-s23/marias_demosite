Working Wives Mothers, Give Help to Nation Washington Working wives and mothers will be successful both in the home and in the office if the community and the nation gives them a helping hand.  That's the opinion of Dr. Anne Gary Pannell, who practices what she preaches. At 40, she is mother of two young sons as well as newly-appointed president of Sweet Briar college in Virginia; She contends that "woman-power is the last great source of labor," but cautions that it must be mobilized effectively." That means, in part, that the community and nation should, set up additional nurseries, shopping, cleaning and sewing facilities to help the working housewife. Assistance Urged  "I don't believe that women are weaker as mothers because they hold jobs," Dr. Pannell told Sweet Briar alumnae. "I do feel the community should help these working women by co-operatively tackling her household chores." Such community assistance also will be a boon to the working wife and mother in event of war when, she pointed out, "there will be more divided homes and absent fathers."  To get the best results from the women labor force in case of war, Dr. Pannell contended, don't draft women haphazardly or tuck them away in any vacant job.  "Women themselves are best fitted to map out the individual jobs they do," she said, "There should be screening of women to determine vocational aptitudes." Decision Theirs She suggested also that in time of crisis, it should be the women who should make the decisions about the rights and welfare of children. College, she said, is essential in preparing women for her many roles in life. "Girls should first of all have a set of values to go by, and be trained to think for themselves," she said. "That is, more important than specific vocational training. "Women have to be far more adaptable than men, since they will not only be wives and mothers, but also may be called upon to serve as breadwinners."
