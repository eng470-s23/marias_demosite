RELIGION SOLVES PROBLEM Fairbanks Tells How Capital and  Labor May "Get Together" Toronto. Ont., Oct. 9. The Ecumenical Methodist Conference today continued its work by considering under  numerous subdivisions the general topic "The Study of Scriptures." Charles W. Fairbanks, formerly VicePresident of the United States, said he felt individual service is most effective  when co-operative with that of the  church. He said: "If there is to be a  cessation of conflict between labor and capital, it will have to come through  the Christian religion and its teachings. Religion has taught the problems of child labor." he continued, "better surroundings and women labor. But its  ideals are a long way from being realized. Religion desmans that for the  same service a woman should receive  the same wages as a man receives. A  people cannot rise higher than its  womanhood rises, and it is the  churches' privilege to life woman into  her true dignity."
