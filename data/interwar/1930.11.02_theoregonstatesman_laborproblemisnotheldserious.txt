LABOR PROBLEM IS NOT HELD SERIOUS Two-Thirds men Wanting Work Transients; few Local men Suffer Unemployment situation for Salem does not look so bad now as it did a week ago, according to Sim Phillips, director of the U.S. employment service office here. Phillips says there are still plenty of unemployed men, but as far as he is able to check, fully two-thirds of them are transients. Not as many local men are out of work as have been, he believes. Phillips received an emergency call yesterday for Sunday laborers for cutting and pealing piling. The past week, 120 men registered for jobs and 46 were placed, while six of the 17 women seeking work through the bureau got jobs.  Analysis of the registrations and placements shows 22 of the 65 common laborers registered went to work; one of the four carpenters got work; 14 of the 20 agricultural laborers and four of the 11 farm hands secured jobs, as did three of the eight woods laborers and two of the four watchmen. The six women who were placed included: two agricultural laborers, one laundry helper; one kitchen worker; and two hotel housekeepers.
