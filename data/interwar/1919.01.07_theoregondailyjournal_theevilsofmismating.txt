The Evils of Mismating The Dalles, Or., Dec. 22. To the Editor of The Journal I believe, with "Olga," that at least the women who have any male support could and should yield their positions to returning soldiers, or try to secure lighter and less strenuous jobs. The world now acknowledges that women, for the most part, are equal to men. In the past the woman was indeed too obscure and downtrodden, but now that her fight for equality is recognized is no reason she need go to extremes and neglect wifehood and motherhood, which must be done more or less if she is to lead a public life of any kind. Too many have come to look down upon the most sacred calling of womanhood, and call it drudgery. What folly! I believe it is mainly our marriage system that sends so many women out into the world, away from home. So many are mismated, and produce restless, discontented children. It is these that are going to extremes. Let us teach children how to choose a mate carefully, not just for looks, money or position teach them to choose on their own level mentally. Let them be congenial, then wifehood, motherhood and home will come into rightful place. I see no permanent relief until congenial mating is reached. Then not only will public women laborers become less, but many other evils will also disappear, such as defective, immoral, thieving, hating, killing humanity, which will come forth no more. Schools are needed everywhere to enlighten those of marriageable ages, aa well as help those already mismated. M. CLARK.
