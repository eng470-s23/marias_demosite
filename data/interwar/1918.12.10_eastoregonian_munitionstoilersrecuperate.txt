MUNITIONS TOILERS RECUPERATE BY TILLING FARMS LONDON, Nov. 16 (By mail.) The English girls who have toiled so hard making munitions to back the boys have not only given their time and their work, but many of them have given their most precious possession health. An interesting and successful experiment has been made in transferring groups of girls from munition factories to work on the land. The doctors had recommended that these women should get into the open air, where they would have a chance to recover their original vitality. The women's branch of the food production department has given the care of these girls special attention. So successful has the experiment been the welfare workers of these respective branches of women's labor are establishing centers on the same line so that the good work of restoring munition girls to health may be continued.
