CHAPTER NAT'L. LADIES' LEAGUE IS ORGANIZED Open-mindedly, and non-partisanly, the league has studied problems of national and international importance and from time to time conducts classes in citizenship. Women voters from both republican and democratic parties are enthusiastic workers in the organization, but the League itself is strictly non-partisan. It sponsors measures, not candidates. It is unique in its no-partisanship and is intensely patriotic, upholding the Constitution and working for the welfare of the country, for the removal of legal discriminations against women by specific measures not prejudicial to women's labor laws or to social welfare legislation.
