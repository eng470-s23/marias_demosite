Farmerettes of Colleges Are Increasing Land Workers' Clubs Take Many Women to Country for Vacation Work. THERE is nothing like a seasoned farmerette for playing the Pied Piper and calling others after her! Sixty percent of the farmerettes of last year were college women. The steady growth of land-workers' clubs in the different colleges testify to their power of persuading their fellow students to seek an entire change from the winter's intellectual strain, by engaging in the free activities of farm life during vacation time. These college, clubs will doubtless become leading factors in recruiting women's labor for next summer. Among the colleges already boasting of such organizations may be listed: Barnard college, Goucher, Mount Holyoke, Randolph-Macon. Simmons, Smith, Sweet Briar, Wellesley, Wells college, Wheaton. Wilson, and 5 Women's college of Delaware.  The clubs are affiliating with the United States employment service, department of labor.
