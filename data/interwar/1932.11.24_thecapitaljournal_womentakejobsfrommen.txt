WOMEN TAKE JOBS FROM MEN SAYS WORKER Cincinnati, Ohio, Not. 24 (AP) At least one woman blames women for a part of the unemployment among American men. She is Miss Mary Anderson, former immigrant and factory worker, who was here today to address the American federation of labor convention.  Miss Anderson, director of the women's bureau of the department of labor says many American fathers with children to support are jobless because women will take work paying only $4 and $5 a week, but "what," she asked, "can be done about it?" "Women don't want to take low wages," she said. "But, they have to take whatever they can get. "Women have dependents just as men have. Women have decrepit parents and helpless little brothers and sisters, too." She used figures to illustrate how women workers have increased, often to the accompaniment of wholesale discharging of men. "There were two and one-half million more women employed in 1930 than in 1920. They got one-third to one-half less pay than men were getting for the same work. "Hence, many employers, finding they could hire women for less than they were paying men, fired the men and took on more women workers. "It used to be the competition of immigrants that hurt American labor now it's the competition of women; and from women it is extending to negro men and negro women." The only way American women can raise their working standards is through organization, Miss Anderson believes, but she does not countenance the idea of a separate labor union for women.
