Women Should Enter Athletics The statement that women and girls should not enter into athlete sports is a mistake. One of the main arguments against women entering athletics is that women do not need the exercise as much as the men. A close study of the problem would indicate that they do not need the exercise as much if not more than men. Why? Let us first observe the conditions under which women labor. A woman's work keeps her indoors, while man's work does not. Good, wholesome sports takes ones mind from dull routine and brings one outside of the home. Therefore, women should have this kind of exercise.
