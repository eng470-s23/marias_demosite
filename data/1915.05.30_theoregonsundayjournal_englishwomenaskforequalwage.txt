English Women Ask For an Equal Wage London, May 29. The government civil service commissioners have announced the schedule of wages to be paid for clerical labor to women who will be employed to release males for military service. The weekly rates follow: Typists, 20 shillings ($4.80), ordinary clerical work, 21 to 25 shillings; shorthand typists, 26 shillings; supervising clerks, 80 shillings. These rates are from a fifth to a third lower than the wages paid to temporary male labor in the same positions, and women's associations and trades unions have lodged vigorous protests. They insist that women should be paid the same rates as the men they replace and urge that the government example will be used by outside employers to exploit women's labor to the detriment of men.
