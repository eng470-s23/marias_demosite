WOMEN'S ACTIVITIES "When Woman, Works," a two reel film showing conditions of the woman at work all over the land, will be shown in Salem this week under the auspices of the Tri-L club, an organization of business girls. They have arranged to have it shown one day during the noon hour at the Y. W. C. A. rooms on Liberty street. It will be shown at the Oregon Thursday, October 13. It is the hope of those in charge of the showing of the film in Salem to have it exhibited at the state institutions while it is here. No definite announcement has been made regarding such exhibition, however. The film has its plot with a true to form heroine, villain and finally the hero does the regular thing for heroes to do rescues the heroine. If there is a sob it is a legitimate one, and the only thing illegitimate is the working conditions shown. The scenes were taken in one of the big factories of the country, the owner loaning his plant for the filming of the scenes. A promise of better things is given in the picture and the women's labor bureau feels that in bringing actual conditions to more favored women, a spirit of interest and helpfulness will be aroused.
