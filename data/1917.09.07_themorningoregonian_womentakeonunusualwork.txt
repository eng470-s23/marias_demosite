Women Take on Unusual Work. As more and more men were called to the front women were employed In unusual work. The new underground road in Berlin is being built largely by women labor. This is not so difficult a matter in Berlin as in New York, because Berlin is built upon a bed of sand and the difficulties of rock excavation do not exist. Women are employed on the railroads, working with pickaxes on the roadbed. Women drive the great yellow post carts of Berlin. There were women guards on the underground road, conductors on the tramways, and women even became motormen on the tramcars. Banks, insurance companies and other large business institutions were filled with women workers, who invaded the sacred precincts of many military and governmental offices.
