The Inalienable Right to be  Selfish  An illustration may be found in the Oregon law limiting the hours of women's labor in laundries. That law went to the United States supreme court and was there sustained. Yet it will not be disputed that there are some women who are physically able to work without harm to themselves for more than ten hours a day in a laundry and that some of them would find it to their pleasure to do so. But there are countless other women whose health would be undermined by long hours of work. The court held that as healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring, the physical well-being of woman is an object of public interest and that the regulation of her hours of labor falls within the police powers of the state. The presumably inalienable right to choose the kind and manner of employment there gives way to the general need.
