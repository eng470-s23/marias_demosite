‘But not fast enough’ Women, labor are changing "Women have been a vital part of the labor movement." Today things have changed, “but not to the degree some of us would like.” The speaker was Nellie Fox recently elected Womens' Activities Director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). She has been involved in labor union activities for the past 20 years and has been termed one of the most effective lobbyists in Salem. Her Wednesday speech in the EMU was entitled, "Women in the Work Force." The AFSCME is a Public Employee Union, affiliated with the AFL-CIO. It specializes in representing state and local government employees, and employees of non-profit organizations. "Most people are ignorant of what labor unions are all about,” Fox said. One of the most important functions of a labor union, she pointed out, is to provide a procedure for handling grievances and questionable terminations. She also said that the majority  of labor problems stem from the inability of labor representatives and management representatives to come to an agreement, or from one side not living up to an agreement made. Women in the labor movement in the past have been silent, she said, recalling the plight of women workers of the past who withstood long hours and unsanitary conditions while working in industry. Fox said that some women of today are "until workers” — working until the refrigerator is paid for, until the kids are out of school. But it doesn’t always work out that way. “The women’s liberation movement is teaching women to think for themselves,” Fox said. She thinks this is bringing about a change in organized labor.
