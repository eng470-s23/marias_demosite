ECONOMIC WAR NOW WAGED BY ENGLISH WOMEN LONDON Correspondence of the Associated Press An economic battle is being waged over the 1,500,000 unemployed women of the country who earned good wages chiefly as munitions workers during the war. Some English newspapers and commentators are asking if a sex war is one of the sinister possibilities of the future. They point out that the situation is more dangerous than when the suffragettes were wont to smash windows and terrorize the London police, because the women did not then know the full measure of their power. Since the armistice was signed it has become more and more apparent that these 1,500,000 women workers would have to return to private life so as to give opportunity of employment for returning soldiers. Hut they have not accepted the situation with good grace, and have answered the challenge of the economic condition by strong organizations, whose avowed intention is to safeguard the position of women in industry. The most important of these is Lady Rhondda's newly inaugurated Women's Industrial League, which has opened offices in London and sent organizers into all parts of the country Lady Rhodda's plans are viewed with suspicion and some measure of distrust by professional women labor leaders. Dr Marion Phillips, chief woman officer of the labor party, asserts that the agitation conducted by Lady Rhondda's league is calculated to lead to bitterness and sex strife between men and women workers.
