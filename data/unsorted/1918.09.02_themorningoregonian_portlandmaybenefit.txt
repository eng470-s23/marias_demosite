PORTLAND MAY BENEFIT VANCOUVER FEARS RESULT WAGE INCREASE. Employers of Women Labor Anxious to Know What Oregon Commission is Going to Do. VANCOUVER, Wash., Sept 1. (Special.) The action of representatives of employers and employes in war conference with the Industrial Welfare Commission in raising the wages of girls and women to $13.20 per week, a flat salary, may have the effect of assisting Portland at the expense of local employers of feminine labor, unless the Oregon Commission takes similar action and raises the minimum of wages to the same standard in Portland. The old scale was $8.90 to $10 per week. The new rate, which will become effective as soon as approved by the commission, is to be effective for at least six months after the war. The number of hours women may work is fixed at eight by legislation. Local employers of women labor are not complaining so much about the rise they will no doubt have to pay, but are interested in what the Oregon Commission is going to do. Portland laundries solicit business in Vancouver and do the work in Portland, where the scale is lower. It is the same in other industries. It may be, however, that the higher wage will attract help to Vancouver, and just now getting enough help is a serious problem.
