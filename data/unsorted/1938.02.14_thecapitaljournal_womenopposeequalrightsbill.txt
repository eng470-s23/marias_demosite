Women Oppose Equal Rights Bill Much opposition has developed against the equal rights amendment pending in congress and scheduled to be reported out by the senate judiciary committee early this week. The objections come principally from representatives of garment workers and other women's labor organizations, from the Catholic National Welfare council, the Massachusetts Women's Constitutional league, the National Women's Suffrage association and the National League of Women voters. Pauline Newman of New York representing women in textile mills denounced the proponents "with being numerically insignificant, industrially ignorant, politically highly theoretical and socially quite muddled." The measure is opposed because it might invalidate protective legislation covering women workers, such as minimum wage and maximum hour laws. Legal chaos would result in various fields in the event of the adoption of the blanket amendment providing that "women shall have equal rights with men in the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction." Another objection is that it would extend the powers of congress to legislate on matters heretofore under the jurisdiction of the states, thereby removing the protective laws for women. It is also contended that the proper way to give women equal right with men as regards control over children, property and residence is through state legislation specifically removing unjust discrimination.
