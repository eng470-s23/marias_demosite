Shipbuilding Only a Part. Shipbuilding is only a part of the Clyde and the Glasgow war activities. Here are great munition plants, in which literally armies of uniformed women labor; airplane and airship factories, tank and gun and gas factories. There is no branch of war industry that cannot be found in this region of Scotland. Probably the greatest certainly the most interesting of the big plants on the Clyde is that of William Beardmore  & Co. Before the war this concern built only ships. Now, in addition to ships, it makes guns, shells, airplanes, airships and tanks. It has expanded from a pay roll that included 4800 men  to a pay roll that includes 35,000 persons, about 12,000 of whom are women.  I asked the general manager, Mr.  Campbell, of this company, if it be came necessary could his firm expand still further. "Beyond question we could," he said. "We are not near our limit yet."
