Many British Women Will Continue To Hold Jobs London, Dec. 14. (By mail) Wanted: Work for 500,000 women. The number of women who will be thrown out of work by the ending of the war is not so great as imagined. About one and a half million extra women have been employed in the United Kingdom since July, 1914, but the number of killed and disabled men amounts to about one million. Therefore there remain 500,000 women workers who will be displaced. Their displacement will come gradually and they will not be thrown on the labor market at once, for 1-3 of the increase in women's labor consists of dilutees. Until the men come back they will remain at their jobs. In the meantime many new spheres have sprung up for women. They will continue making tools and machinery, they will be employed in subsidiary ship building industries, they will do their share in the chemical trades; and also, there are two quite new branches of work open to women of the United Kingdom the manufacture of pianos and toys, both of which industries are being wrested from the hands of the Hun. The outlook for women is cheerful.
