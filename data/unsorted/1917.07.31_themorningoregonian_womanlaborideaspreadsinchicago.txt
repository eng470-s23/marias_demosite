WOMAN LABOR IDEA SPREADS IN CHICAGO SEVERAL LARGE PLANTS CONSIDER EMPLOYMENT. Several Hundred Work In Car Shops for 30 Cents Per Hour and All Wear Overalls. CHICAGO, July 30. Employment of several hundred women as laborers by the Ryan car plant, South Chicago, begun as an experiment several weeks ago, has proved so successful that several other large manufacturers are considering the advisability of adopting the plan. The women range in age from 18 to 45 years, receive 30 cents an hour and work eight hours a day. Experience has shown that in the lighter tasks the women perform as much work as men, but in the heavier lines one man will often do twice as much work as a woman. About 75 percent of the women who begin work at the plant remain, while the others quit after a few days. The women wear overalls and are provided with special washrooms.
