Sho was remanded for a more extended hearing. Mrs. Rigby declared it was she who last Tuesday burned down the country estate at Rivington or Sir William Lever, causing damage estimated at $100,000. She Further confessed to being the perpetrator of an outrage at the Liverpool cotton exchange July 5, when a  bomb exploded but caused little damage. Mrs. Rigby surrendered voluntarily to the police. When arraigned  today, she gloried in her achievements, saying that she wanted Sir  William Lever to consider whether  his house was more valuable as a  show place than as a beacon lighted  for the King and the country to see  women suffering an insupportable  grievance. She said, "I chose the  Liverpool cotton exchange because  the cotton industry has been built  up largely by women's labor. Merchants are willing to get power and  wealth out of the labor of women,  while the women themselves are denied the right to vote and citizenship.
