WORK UNDER UNSANITARY CONDITIONS New York. Sept. 28. Due to the findings of the state factory investigating committee that body is to demand from the legislature the wiping out of many of the awful conditions under which women labor in the Empire state. "Conditions under which women have to work here are inhuman beyond belief," declared Senator Robert F. Wagner, of the Investigating committee today. "The women In the slaughter houses in Buffalo, in the ore foundries at Utica and in the harvester twine plant at Auburn are especially to be pitied. In the slaughter houses they are forced to work on wet floors with no protection for their feet. In Utica and Auburn they are subjected to intolerable sanitary conditions. All of these women have to do man's labor. I look for the general establishment of these Investigating commissions."
