Delicate Gown Made for Empress Eugenie It is said that the most perishable thing ever made was the gown of EmÂ­press Eugenie designed for her to wear at a ball given at the Tuileries upon her return from the opening of the Suez canal. The ultimate in dress was made under the personal direction of the empress. Four women labored steadily for six months embroidering the flounces. It took two months to manufacture the gauze. The cloth was woven on machinery especially constructed and was the only kind of this material ever fashioned. The threads were so fine that the weavers were obliged to wear powerful magnifying glasses.
