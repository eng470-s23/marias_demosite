JAPANESE GOODS BOYCOTT BEGINS Boycott on Japanese goods which was ordered recently by the Women's Labor Congress in Seattle, will go into effect in immediately following I meeting of the Women's Auxiliary of Wood Workers set for Thursday evening, according to local officials. Pearl Wright and Mrs. Naomi Michaels of this city returned Monday evening from Seattle where they attended the congress. "It is not the intention of the organisation to put people out of work in factories which manufacture silk hose." said Miss Wright Wednesday afternoon. "The factories will probably manufacture cotton, lisle end rayon hose instead of silk. Women in many other places are already wearing wool, lisle or cotton hose."
