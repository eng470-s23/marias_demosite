Keeping Rubber Away From Germans I visited one plant which sends out rubber bands by the carload, making enough every week to bury from sight a team of horses and a dozen men standing around them. It makes rubber belts and conveyors which are miles in extent and for hospital use rubber sheets which would cover acres. Akron has factories that make rubber goods for every possible want, from the nipple that feeds milk to the baby to the hot water bottle that warms the chilled feet of the aged on the edge of the grave. It makes rubber boots for the trenches and diving suits for going under the sea. It makes dirigible balloons for piercing the clouds and airplane tires to soften the descent of the great flying machines as they land from the skies. It makes, in short, so many things of rubber that the names alone would take more space than I have for this letter. Many of its products are of vital necessity to us in our war with the Germans, and the most of the factories are now working on war orders. There are 30 establishments all told. They cover thousands of acres, and some of the larger of them have as many as 10,000 men and women laboring away under one roof.
