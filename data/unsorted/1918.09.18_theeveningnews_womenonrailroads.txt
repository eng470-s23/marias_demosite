WOMEN ON RAILROADS. The number of railroad jobs that women are able to hold has increased tremendously since the war began. One of the first new jobs for women was car cleaning, and they have been engaged in this work in the Boston yards of the Boston & Albany Railroad for many months. Now the railroad administration contemplates the employment of women almost exclusively as clerks, accountants, ticket sellers, station agents, crossing watchmen, and car cleaners, in which jobs they can release men for the army or for more important work. To some extent. It is understood, women will be employed as track laborers. Every effort will be made to guard the safety and health of these women workers, and it is probable that the work of the women in industry service of the department of labor will bo of great value in solving problems connected with their employment. Women will be paid the same as men for the same work. English and French railroads were long ago compelled to hire women for railroad work on an extensive scale. In France the women even act as firemen on locomotives There are training schools for women ticket agents in several large cities already, where young women between the ages of 21 and 35 years are given two months courses in railroad geography and simple accounting. They are paid $25 a month while learning and afterwards receive from $65 to $200 a month. The "Deneor Opportunity School" is a unique institution which is creating now fields for women's labor. More than 100 young women and girls have learned automobile operating and repairing there within the lost few months, in order to fit themselves for such service and to release men for the army or munition shops.
