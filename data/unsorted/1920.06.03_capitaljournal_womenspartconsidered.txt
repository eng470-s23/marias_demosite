Women's Part Considered.The national committee's sub-committee to consider the part women are to play in the government of this party held a pre-breakfast session today but failed to reach definite conclusions. Victor Heintz of Cincinnati, mid-west region director for the national committee, was commissioned to present certain views to leading republican women and to advise the sub-committee so that a definite plan may be recommended to the full national committee next Monday.  The committee is confronted with the task of harmonizing the views of two schools of thought among the women. One asks dual control of the party with parallel organization of men and women. The other said that "adequate representation" of the women on the governing bodies of the paries would be wiser. A meeting of women has been called for Sunday afternoon and all feminine delegates and alternates to the convention, as well as other leading republican women, have been invited to attend. About 300 are expected to take part in the deliberations.
