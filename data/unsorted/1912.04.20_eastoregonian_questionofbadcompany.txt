The Question of Bad Company. Colonel Roosevelt quotes with approval a remark of Dr. C. W. Saleeby that he finds it needs "constant bracing up of the judgment" to hold to his faith in equal suffrage in the face of the extreme and objectionable theories advocated by some suffragists. He might get it very well braced by observing the attitude of the solid vice and villainy of the nation toward woman suffrage. On which side are all the undesirable classes of men that the colonel excoriates so severely those who beat their wives and neglect to support their children, the exploiters of women's labor and of child labor, those who profit by the white slave trade and the mass of its patrons? There is some bad company to be found on both sides; but by far the largest amount of the country's immorality is in the camp of the anti-suffragists.  Mrs. Howe had a much longer and wider experience of suffragists than the colonel. She often said that one of the pleasures resulting to her from her conversion to the cause was that it brought her into "such high company." She had expected to find the men and women working for it wild and objectionable; she found most of them the salt of the earth. There were some undesirables even in the early days, and with the enormous spread of the movement in recent years, all sorts of people have of course been swept into it;; yet Mrs. Howe could write in her reply to Mrs. Humphrey Ward, in the London Times of October 1, 1908: "In the experience of many years, I have always found the advocates of woman suffrage occupying higher moral ground than that held by their opponents." "We who are gathered here." she said at a suffrage convention, "are not condemners of marriage nor neglectors of home and offspring. We are individually allowed to be men and women of sound intellect, of reputable life." This has always been true of the great bulk of the suffragists.
