SOAP FACTORY JOB PAYS WAY AT BRYN MAWR Kansas City, Kan., Sept. 30. After putting in two months at Bryn Mawr college this summer, Miss Louise Beauchamp of this city is back at the soap factory, where she is a forewoman. The previous education this Kansas girl had enjoyed halted abruptly at the eight grade. She then went to work in the factory wrapping cakes of soap. She continued at it several years, until she was chosen to go to Bryn Mawr, with all expenses paid. This was part of an experiment conducted by the college authorities, women labor leaders and alumnae this year for the first time. Eighty-one factory workers in various parts of the country were given scholarships, and had every advantage of college life and education at this well-known Pennsylvania institution. Then they went back to the work they had left.
