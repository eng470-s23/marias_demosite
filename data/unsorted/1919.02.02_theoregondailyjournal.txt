WOMEN OF WORLD THANK WILSON FOR FOSTERING RIGHTS President Makes Touching Reply to French Women Who Call at Villa Murat to Greet Him. DESIRE FOR A NEW WORLD Unspoken Suffering of Heart One of Tragical Things of War Borne by Wives and Mothers. By Harry Hansen Special Cable to The Journal and The Chicago Daily News (Copyright. 1919, by Chicago Daily News Co.) Paris, Feb. 1. The question of the position of women in the various countries cannot be taken up by the peace conference because it is an internal matter and the likelihood of the conference doing anything for women depends entirely upon what it will do for labor, of which women's labor a naturally a part, and which is now made an international issue. This was the stand taken by President Wilson in an address to a delegation of 80 French women who called at the Villa Murat to express their gratitude for his share in ending the war and also to plead that he sweep aside all egotism and selfishness of peoples and not be tempted by compromises. In his extemporaneous response the president said: "In the great matter that you have so much at heart the right of women to take their full share in the government of the nation to which they belong that is necessarily a domestic question for the separate nations. A conference of peace, settling the relations of nations with each other, would be regarded as going very much outside of its province if it undertook to dictate to the several states what their internal policy should be.
