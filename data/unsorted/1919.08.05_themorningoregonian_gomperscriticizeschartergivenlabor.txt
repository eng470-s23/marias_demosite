GOMPERS CRITICIZES CHARTER GIVEN LABOR Greater Rights Asked in Peace Treaty Provision. HUNS DISPUTE ARGUMENT American Leader at Trades Union Conference Pleads for Equality of Women and Men. AMSTERDAM, Aug. 4. (By the Associated Press.) Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, and head of the American council to the international trades union federation in session here, pleaded for greater rights for labor Sunday. His address followed the report of a committee which said it could not accept the charter given labor in the peace treaty as a full expression of the workers' demands. Mr. Gompers demanded that labor should not be regarded as an article of commerce. He urged also that a seamen's act be enacted to permit sailors to leave ships when they were safely in harbor. He pleaded for the equality of women and men, and abolition of involuntary services. German delegates disputed Mr. Gompers' argument, which, thev said, made it appear European labor unions were too conservative. They demanded that the workers strive for a realization of The Berne conference's programme, including regulation of children's education, women's labor, shorter hours. Sunday rest and supervision of home industries.
