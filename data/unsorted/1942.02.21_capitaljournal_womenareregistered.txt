Women Are Registered Lebanon Registration of eastern Linn county women in Oregon's women's labor survey got off to a flying start last Monday, then hit a temporary lull by midweek because of a shortage of registration blanks. As soon as more blanks arrive the work will proceed, Mrs. John G. Gill, chairman, announced. The city of Eugene, she said, was supplied with 200 blanks from Lebanon due to a shortage there and as a result this area found itself in the same fix. Mrs. Gill said the needed materials should be here any day. All districts in the area were being covered according to schedule, and registrations have been coming into the Lebanon employment office daily, until on Thursday about 2000 completed blanks had been received, according to Manager Cal Edwards.
