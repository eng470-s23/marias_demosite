Jobs Are Seeking Men At the employment offices the men capable of getting past a recruiting sergeant were more numerous, but the larger number were elderly men. A. W. Jones, head of the Municipal employment bureau at Ankeny off Third street, explained that there were more now than in the winter. Wages are going up, and the demand for capable men is pressing. The men who come in from the mills with a little money are not tempted to drink or gamble, and they are looking for a better job. The light crops and cooperative work among farmers with the mobilizing of farm machinery, children and women labor, will keep wages down during harvest, he thought.
