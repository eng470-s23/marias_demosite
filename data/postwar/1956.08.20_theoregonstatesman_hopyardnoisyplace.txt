Hopyard Noisy Place Now the yard has begun to wake up. Already the wire-man has let down several wires. Other workers have arrived and several have begun to pick. The men are in khaki trousers and overalls; the majority of the women are dressed likewise. But there are are certain characteristics that mark woman hop picker from all other women laborers. There are the black cotton stockings, with the feet cut off that protect the arms and wrists, the canvas gloves with their leather patches to protect the hands; the large red or blue handkerchief to prevent the throat from becoming scratched. A large, light straw hat, made to fit the head by means of a shoestring drawn through the base of the crown, covers the head. A safety pin, worn in the manner of a fraternity pin, to hold the hop checks, completes the costume. Over the front of the men's and women's clothing alike are dirty brown stains.
