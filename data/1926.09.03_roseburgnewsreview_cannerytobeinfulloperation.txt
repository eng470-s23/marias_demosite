CANNERY TO BE IN FULL OPERATION UNTIL 1ST OF YEAR That the Umpqua Valley Cannery will be in operation until about the first of the year, is the statement made by the manager, Mr. A. J. Geddes. The plant is now packing pears, blackberries, and prunes, and will soon start its long run on apples. The cannery this year is putting up the largest pack in its history, and so far has met with a good market demand, although the prices have not been as good as had been hoped. The greatest difficulty this year has been in the securing of enough women laborers to take care of the fruit. The large volume of pears made it necessary for the cannery to issue an urgent call for workers, and although enough hands were secured to keep the fruit from becoming a loss, there is still a shortage in the number of women employees necessary to keep the plant operating at full capacity as desired. The prune season will bring about the need for still more workers and Mr. Geddes says that many more women can be given employment. The Umpqua Valley cannery has become firmly established as a local industry, and its future growth will be an important factor in the fruit situation in this county.
