Household Hints It is now incumbent upon us to see how far we can substitute the labor of women for that of men, says the New Republic. Before the war it would doubtless have been urged that the private interest of employers had already introduced women's labor wherever this would pay. We have now learned that mere inertia is an important determinant of industrial arrangements. The British government is employing women where it formerly employed only men, and with results that are satisfactory from a financial point of view, as well as from the more essential point of view of economy of national resources. At the Woolwich arsenal, for example, only 125 out of the 10,866 persons employed in August, 1914 were women according to the latest available reports, 25,000 out of 75,500 now employed are women. Women make up over 60 percent of the personnel of the department of design and inspection. In private industry women have found their way into numberless employments formerly monopolized by men. In this movement toward the employment of women the private interest of the employer has been reinforced by patriotic considerations. Doubtless in many instances women are employed where it would be more profitable to employ men, even at scarcity wages. But in time of war such a consideration is of no determining importance.
