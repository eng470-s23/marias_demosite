REGISTERING WOMEN AVAILABLE FOR FARM WORK PLANNED NEXT Purpose Will Be to Relieve as Far as Possible Scarcity of Male Labor. National registration of women available for work on farms is planned by the department of labor as one of the advance steps in a campaign to secure a sufficiency of farm labor for every section of the country during the coming season. A. L. Barkman, chief of the division of farm service announces:  "Women will be needed for truck gardening, gathering fruit, milking, and other light forms of labor." "The country faces a shortage of farm labor next season. The heavy snows in the Central West should mean wheat aplenty. If the favorable weather conditions continue, one of the biggest yields on record may be expected. The problem now is to get a plentiful supply of labor, and on this the division of farm service is at the present concentrating its energies. "The most serious farm labor shortage last year was in the East. The industries there filling war orders took men who otherwise would have been available for farm work by the offer of attractive wages. The farmers will have to increase wages much more than they have to get men to come from the cities. They have not raised wages anywhere in proportion to their increase in profits. "The college girls and the women of the leisure classes who are ready to respond to a call for workers as a matter of patriotic service must be depended upon chiefly for the women labor that will be needed."
