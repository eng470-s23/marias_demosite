CHERRY CO-OP WORKS 2 SHIFTS ON ROYAL ANNES Two shifts for sorting Royal Anne cherries were put on yesterday at the old Southern Pacific warehouse by the Willamette Cherry Growers association putting on a monster cherry barreling deal there under supervision of Robert Shinn, manager. Each shift is working 8 hours a day. Shinn states the latter part of the month he expects to have crews on pitting the share of the pack contracted for delivery pitted. However, a considerable share of the tonnage will be shipped un-pitted. Low wages paid in the east for women's labor makes taking on a pitting job on a large scale out here a rather precarious undertaking this year with enforcement of the minimum wage scale of 27.5 cents an hour, against labor which can be secured there are $3 and $4 a week for the same work.
