RETURN TO FIGHT AWAITED Ridding Country of Enemy Justifies Taking of Human Life, Is Declaration of Young Heroine. Comrades Are Brave. BY ARNO DOSCH-FLEUROT. (Copyright, 1917, by the Press Publishing Company. Published by arrangement with the New York World.) PETROGRAD, July 30. (Special.) The story of the first girl in the Women's Battalion to kill a German has just been given me by the heroine herself as she lay in the hospital wounded. She is Mary Goloubyova, an 18-year-old high school student. Mary is tall and graceful, with pretty blue eyes, her blonde hair, now short, giving her the appearance of a handsome boy. Laughing at the wounds which caused her to be sent to the hospital, she showed her brilliant white teeth. Even the rough hospital nightgown could not conceal her well-developed, beautiful figure.
