DEMOCRATIC PARTY MAKING READY FOR THE NEXT CAMPAIGN OLD PLATFORM RECALLED Discriminatory Difference Between White and Colored Women Laborers Is Said To Be Nearly 100%. (By The Columbian Press) Washington D.C. May 6, "We pledge the Democratic Party to cooperate with the State governments for the welfare, education, and protection of child life and all necessary safeguards against exhaustive debilitating employment conditions for women." The above paragraph is quoted from the Democratic national platform of 1924, adopted at New York, and now in the slow but sure process of resurrection for next year, when the political progeny of Wilson and Bryan again assemble to map out a new plan of government for the U.S.A. The facts, however belie the fiction (Continued From Page One) of the platform of the Democratic party. In a survey recently made of 151 South Carolina industrial plants, typical of the Democratic area, in which there were employed 10,328 white women, 843 Negro women, and 590 girls under 16 years of age - a total of 11,761 employees of the class which the Convention platform specially pledged itself to SAFEGUARD AND PROTECT, it was found that the 60-hour week and the 10-hour day were sapping away the vitality of the Democratic mothers and daughters; and that the median earnings in all types of manufacturing occupations, of white women were from $9.50 to $9.60 per 60-hour week, while the median earnings for Negro women ranged from $4.90 to $6.00 per 60-hour week, - a discriminatory difference, for the same type of labor, of from $3.60 to $4.60 per week, by median, or nearly ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. In general mercantile manufacture white women received $15.50 per week, while colored women received $6.20; in goods manufacture, whites receive $7.60, Negroes, $4.85; yarn and cotton goods brought wages to whites of $12.00 per week; while Negroes received $6.70. Of all the women whose week's earnings were recorded, 71.2 percent of the white women earned less than $12.00, while 98.4 percent of the Negro women fell below the same weekly wage. And for the same two racial groups, 86.9 percent of the white women earned less than $15.00, while 99.8 percent of the Negro women were below the "coveted" $15.00 per week. The survey report concluded with the dismaying information that "the results of extensive underpayment of large groups of women, with the lowering of the standard of living below the level not only of comfort but of health itself and the elimination of all chance of saving or providing for the future, cannot be too strongly emphasized." Thus, with the Democratic party, pledges go on forever; so do poverty, unwholesome working conditions and low wages. And these evils are what unscrupulous and ignorant voters stimulate whenever they vote into public office the political tools of southern "captains" of industry.
