RECONCILIATION. Before the Democratic Administration has completed its programme of tariff, trust, currency and conservation laws, new issues of the type described may have pushed those questions to one side in public estimation. The question will then be, not whether women's labor shall be restricted and regulated; not whether child labor shall be prohibited; not whether men who sell shoddy as wool, paper as leather, poison as food, shall be punished, but how the law shall do these things. There are many, of whom Jane Addams and Judge Lindsey are types, who regard a party as a mere instrument and will readily support any party which will do that which they consider of first importance. That party may well be the Republican party if progressive leadership is now accepted. It would then draw to its support, the whole band of social reformers which constituted the most sincere and disinterested element of Roosevelt's following.
