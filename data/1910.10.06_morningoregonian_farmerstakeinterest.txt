Farmers Take Interest. At a big meeting at Dunfanaghy Courthouse, attended by farmers for miles around. Hugh Law, the Nationalist M. P. for north Donegal, made a powerful speech for woman suffrage and offered a resolution supporting it to those of his constituents who were present, which was passed unanimously. Peter Kerr-Smiley, of County Antrim. Is another Ulster Nationalist who is backing the cause of the suffragettes. All told, a majority of the Nationalist party have pledged themselves as friends to votes for women." The suffrage societies of Belfast have been doing their level best during the past few weeks to force a public investigation of the conditions of sweated female labor in the linen trade recently laid bare in the annual report of Health Inspector Bailie. The incredibly underpaid women of Belfast, many of whom earn less than 6 cents a day for making "hand-made" shirts, constitute an obvious example, they urge, of the callousness of a male electorate in dealing with the exploitation of women labor. Miss Wary Galway, the well-known labor leader, has been especially prominent in the agitation, and is pressing on the women of Belfast the great need for united action in this and the other social exposures that so particularly concern women. From here it is only a short step, for Miss Galway Mrs. D. W. Elliott, and the other women leaders to point to the vote as the only remedy that can permanently insure decent conditions of working and livelihood for the working woman.
