Mt. Tabor P.-T. Association Elects Mrs. J. A. Eastman Is Chosen President and Mrs. S. Elliott Finch Vice President. By Vella Winner There are now 3,378,998 women registered for service according to their specialized talents under the woman's committee of the Council of National Defense, The majority are registered for industries and agriculture. This census is being taken by the state committees of the council. These figures represent the incomplete registration returns from 25 states. The census taking has been retarded by the tremendous amount of clerical work, and in some districts by the misunderstanding of persons who believed that the act of registering was equivalent to compulsory labor. A second registration drive will begin in the early fall. The Pennsylvania division has carried the registration through to the extent that the organization is able to report 1481 "placements" of women in work. An informative campaign will precede the second drive. Women librarians in the camp hospitals are to wear uniforms. The commanding officers in charge at the different cantonments have asked the American Library association, which supplies these librarians through its library war service, that uniforms be adopted. The uniform is a natural-colored pongee shirt-waist dress, worn with a white collar and dark brown tie. On the sleeve is a dark brown brassard, bearing the letters A. L. A. A Panama hat with a brown hand and an A L. A pin is part of the uniform, which was chosen as the most practical for summer wear in all parts of the country.
