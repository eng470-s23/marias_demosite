Dwyer is focusing on pension reform and the backlog in civil rights cases as major issues in his campaign.  He asserts that employes are often cheated on pension plans, and that people are often "locked into their jobs" because of pension plans. Noting that there is almost always a long wait for civil rights plaintiffs, Dwyer said he would expand this department to give complaints prompt attention. Dwyer also said apprenticeship programs should be more receptive towards women and that he would work actively in behalf of women's labor rights.
