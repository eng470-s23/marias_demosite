WOMAN LABOR LAW HITS Laundries and Telephone Companies Affected by Washington Statute. VANCOUVER. Wash., July 16. (Special.) The eight-hour law for women, which went into effect June 8, 1911, will have a tendency, so employers of women labor contend, to cause women to be crowded out and their places filled by men, in some cases, by Japanese.  Laundries, which are large employers of women labor, have to compete with Portland, where there is not an eight-hour law for women. The laundries are unable to raise their prices, but the cost of production is necessarily more. In some of the hotels girls have been replaced with Japanese, and the dining room closed three hours during the afternoon, when trade is light. The telephone company has been compelled to add a number of girls.
