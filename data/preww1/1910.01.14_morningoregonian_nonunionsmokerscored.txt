Nonunion Smoker Scored. The finding of a sack of non-union- made tobacco on the floor when the convention met today started a brisk discussion on the union label question. Charles Leyle, of the Cigarmakers' Union of Seattle, flourished a sack of tobacco and invited the offending union man to come forth and disclose his   identity. "The man who would buy and bring  into this convention a package of tobacco made under conditions unfair to organized labor outrages the principles of unionism." said Mr. Leyle. "Let the man who owns this tobacco come here and I'll give it to him. This is no laughing matter. The man who would do a thing of this sort violates the oath he has taken." Although there was a lot of looking about to see who had a guilty look, the owner of the tobacco was content to leave it in the hands of Mr. Leyle without disclosing his identity.
