ENGLISH WOMEN ARE ANSWERING THE CALL FOR PEOPLE TO WORK Take Places of Men in Ammunition Factories; Men Have Gone to War, By Wilbur S. Forrest. London, May 12. (By Mail to New York.) Britain, like France, is now mobilizing her women to take the places of men who have gone to war. Thousands are answering the government's recent appeal and are step ping into the harness in scores of trades and occupations. They have flocked to the ammunition factories, army equipment works and industrial establishments in all parts of Eng land. When the British board of trade, England's "commerce and labor" department, issued the appeal, urging all women to enter themselves on the register of "Women for War" at the 400 labor exchanges throughout the country, the effect was practically instantaneous. Dignified butlers and footmen who served in brass and braid during peace times are now in khaki, while hundreds of trim parlor maids are performing the man-tasks with equal skill. The Londoner expresses no surprise nowadays when his laundered linen is de livered in a motor van driven by a smart, businesslike girl. The laundry man has gone to war with the butlers and footmen.
