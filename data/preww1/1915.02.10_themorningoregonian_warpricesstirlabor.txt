WAR PRICES STIR LABOR BRITISH RAILWAY UNIONS URGED TO DEMAND WAGE INCREASE. Employment of Belgians or Women Considered to Relieve Situation in Agriculture as Well. LONDON, Jan. 10. (Correspondence of the Associated Press.) The Increase in prices, brought about by the war, has resulted in unrest among the laboring classes and in widespread demands for better wages. The problem is complicated by the scarcity of labor in some trades, due in part to the number of men who have joined the army. Railway men in all parts of England have passed resolutions urging their union officials to make demands at once for an increase in wages. The manager of the Newcastle street railway system is considering the advisability of employing women car conductors. In many parts of the United Kingdom, agricultural laborers are agitating for an increase in wages. Various plans are under consideration, such as the employment of Belgians or women laborers or the exemption of skilled agricultural laborers from military service.
