Every Woman Has a Right to a Hoosier The Hoosier means more than merely shelf-room -Built in closets scatter your kitchen work; the Hoosier Cabinet centralizes it. You can sit down restfully to prepare each meal with your utensils and food supplies already gathered and handily arranged at your fingers ends. The Hoosier way saves miles of steps and takes but half the time; has 40 inventions that save women labor. The cabinet includes the patented shaker flour sifter, the only sifter that shakes flour through instead of grinding it. It also has a complete accounting system : Mrs. Christine Frederick's Food Guide that answers that question-"What shall I have for dinner?"
