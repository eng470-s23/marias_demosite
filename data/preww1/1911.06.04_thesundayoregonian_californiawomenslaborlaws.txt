CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S LABOR LAWS  WILL BE CONTESTED BY HOTELMAN Limit to 48 Hours a Week Compels Adoption of European Plan in Some  Instances, but Consumer Will Pay in End-Los Angeles Reforms Treatment of Insane LOS ANGELES, June 3. (Special.) Nothing that the recent Legislature did has caused as much trouble as the eight-hour law for women. It has completely upset all walks of commercial, business and professional life and none of them has felt it as much as hotelkeepers. This is natural when one considers the requirements of the hotel. And so the first gun in the grand attack on the eight-hour law was fired when Frank Miller, of Riverside, the other day was arrested and pleaded not guilty to a charge of working the head waitress of the Glenwood Inn longer than the law allows.  Backing Miller are the members of the Southern California Hotel Men's Association and the San Francisco Hotel Men's Association, and the case will be pressed as a teat of the law. The hotel men, as a whole, have been chary of discussing the action, as they had planned to let it be conducted without the associations appearing in it to any extent. "I have several women working for me who have been In my employ for 15 years," said Miller. "It as Impossible for me to conduct my hotel under the eight-hour law and keep these women with me. As a result, I must either discharge them after their years of faithful service or face prosecution. I do not went to discharge them, they want to remain and I have determined to let the Supreme Court of the state say what shall be done.
