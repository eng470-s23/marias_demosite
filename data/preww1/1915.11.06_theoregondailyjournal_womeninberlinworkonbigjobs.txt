Women in Berlin Work on Big Jobs London, Nov. 6. (I. N. S ) Women are now being employed on public works in Berlin, according to the Copenhagen correspondent of the Morning Post. He has received a telegram from Berlin which says women are at work excavating the Friedrichstrasse tunnel, which is to form part of the underground railroad system of Berlin. "The utilization of women's labor for this purpose is so successful," the dispatch says, "that it is now intended to employ them on other big undertakings."
