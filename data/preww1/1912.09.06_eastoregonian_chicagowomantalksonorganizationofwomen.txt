CHICAGO WOMAN TALKS ON ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN 'Men Are Taking Interest in Move," Declares Miss Alice Henry Higher Wages and Shorter Hours Favored. Kansas City, Mo. The importance of the organization of women in labor, not only to themselves, but to men, was emphasized by Miss Alice Henry of Chicago, editor of the official organ of the National Women's Trade Union league, in an address at Labor temple here. "The thing that strikes me in my trips through the country," said Miss Henry, "is the interest men every where are taking in the woman's movement. If the women do not organize to protect themselves, the lower wages which they receive will force down the wage scale of the men. At the present time 6,000,000 girls in the United States are working for an average wage of $6 a week, which means that some are getting less than that. To be efficient, women laborers must have higher wages and shorter hours."
