Women's Labor Law Changed. La Follett's bill to exempt women employed in harvesting and fruit or vegetable drying, canning or packing from the provisions of the 10-hour-day law carried unanimously. Senator Olson, however, seconded by Senator Garland, first obtained an amendment providing that women employed in canning, drying and packing plants must be paid time and one-half over 10 hours.
