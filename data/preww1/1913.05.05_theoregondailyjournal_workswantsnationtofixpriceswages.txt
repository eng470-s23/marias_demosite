WORKS WANTS NATION TO FIX PRICES, WAGES: (United Press Leased Wire.) Washington, May 6. Discussing power of the trusts, John D. Work of California, in the senate today, asserted that responsibility for popular unrest lies with the nation's lawmakers for allowing the masses to remain in a miserable condition. "The Ruling class in America," said Senator Works, "is the moneyed class. Wealth, power and position are arrayed against men and women laboring for a livelihood. They regard themselves as superior to what thev call the 'lower classes.' The only effective way to overcome this evil Is to elevate the station of the wage earners and to curb the powers of the employing class. No better, way to accomplish this, it occurs to me, so far as lawmaking is concerned, can be conceived man to regulate prices and the wages and hours of labor."
