WORKS PLEADS FOR REGULATED WAGE AND DAY Moneyed Class Is Ruling Class and Arrayed Against Toilers Wage Earners Station Should Be Elevated and Employers Curbed. Women Greatest Sufferers by Prevailing Injustice Carnegie Censured Roosevelt's Party Slapped. WASHINGTON', May 5. Discussing the power of tho trusts, John D. Works of California, in the senate today, asserted that responsibility for popular unrest lies with nation's lawmakers fur allowing the masses to remain in a miserable condition. "The ruling class in America," said Senator Works, "is the moneyed class. Wealth, power and position are arrayed against men and women laboring for a livelihood. They regard themselves as superior to what they call the 'lower classes.' "The only effective way to overcome this evil is to elevate the station of the wage earners and to curb the powers of the employing class. No better way to accomplish this, it occurs to me, so far as law makin is concerned, can be conceived than to regulate prices and the wages and hours of labor.
