Depression Not Local. The depression in the paper market during 1913 and 1914 were not local. Wisconsin, Michigan and other parts of the middle west and east felt the pinch. Mills there were shut down 11 completely or running on reduced shifts. It was reported here on good authority at one time in 1914 that unless there was a change for the better one or both of the local mills would shut down. During those months of free trade before the war, Norwegian paper could be laid down in American ports for less than the cost of the domestic  product. Wheat ships accepted cargoes of paper as bal'ast, charging importers little. Women labor in the mills in northern Europe and their wages are small. Up to two years ago Norwegian mills supplied the greater part of the world. Japan and Australia are buying pulp and paper from Oregon City mills now, because they cannot secure it from Norway, but those Norwegian mills are not idle. Immense stocks of paper are now on hand, and the exporters are ready to ship paper to any corner or the globe as soon as the conflict in Europe ends. The day the treaty of peace is Signed in Europe and tonnage is available, American paper manufacturers  must begin again their old fight to  hold their home market in the face  of foreign, cheap labor competition.
