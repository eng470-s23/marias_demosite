Women Are Making Good. But the "chauffeuses" are not confining their activities to laundry vans. The National Motor Cab company boasts that every one of its large fleet of motor vans is driven by a girl. The regular chauffeurs are fighting for their king and country, for the traditional shilling a day, while the girls are garnering five shillings on the work they left behind. Women are driving autos and vans for a half dozen other large London establishments, whose heads are authority for the statement that their services are quite equal to those of their predecessors.  Several provincial cities have already passed into the unprecedented era of women 'bus and tram conductors. London's great system of under-ground railways, 'bus lines and tram lines are still manned by men, but the constant call of the war office for more recruits is bringing nearer this era in London, as it dawned at the beginning of the war in Paris. Women have now invaded exclusive men's clubs where previously they feared to tread. Men servants and waiters have discarded their livery for khaki, and the women have stepped into their shoes. The Athenaeum, one of London's most dignified and stately clubs, where women servants were previously unknown, is today served by attractive housemaids. Erudite bishops and learned professors who inhabit the club declare the innovation is "Jolly well fine."
