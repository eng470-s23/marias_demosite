Enter the Armament Factories.But the greatest majority of British city women have gone into the arma-ment factories. Lord Kitchener in the house of lords recently issued a call for speeding up the work In British industrial plants to satisfy the urgent seed for more army supplies. Hundreds of factories responded to the call and slipped their gears into high speed. This created extra places for workers. Men were scarce in the factory districts. They have gone to war. Then came the government's appeal to women of the land to exercise the"full working power" of Britain while the' "full fighting power" was in the field. Their patriotic response has been most pleasing to the government. It has in many cases eliminated the excuse for failure to enlist, and the men thus released are now enlisting by the thousands.
