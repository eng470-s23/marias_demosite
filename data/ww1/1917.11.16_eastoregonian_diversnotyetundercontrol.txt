DIVERS NOT YET UNDER CONTROL LONDON. Nove. 16.J The submarine menace is not controlled, Sir Eric  Geddes, first lord of the admiralty,  told the house of commons.  Geddes warned against over optimism because recent official statements  show great increase in submarinings.  "Last week's report of our losses  doesn't indicate the submarine menace controlled," Geddes declared. "Its  essential our allies know economy is  necessary. Shipyards are short of men. The women labor sent them  will directly affect the winning of the war. Momentarily we are holding the submarines."
