Sir Geddes Sounds Warning London, Nov. 16. (U. P.) The submarine menace is not yet under control, Sir Eric Geddes, first lord  of the admiralty, told the house of  commons this afternoon.  He solemnly warned against over-optimisim because of recent official  statements showing great decreases  in the loss of shipping. "Last week's repot of our loses  by submarines does not indicate that  the submarine menace is controlled,"  the minister asserted.  "It is essential that our allies know  that economy is necessary. Shipyards are short of men. Women  labor sent them will directly affect  the winning of the war.  "Momentarily we are holding the  submarines, but I repeat my warning."  Recent statements have shown a  regular decrease in sinking week  by week, so that the public in England for the last few days has been  jubilating more or less in the belief that the problem had been  solved.
