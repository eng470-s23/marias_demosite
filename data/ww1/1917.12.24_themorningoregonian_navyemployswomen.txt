NAVY EMPLOYS WOMEN LARGE CLOTHING PLANTS GIVE WORK TO GENTLER SEX. Consideration Now Being Given Proposition of Introducing Woman Laborers in Gun Factories, Navy-yards. WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. (Special.) Unable to compete with private indus tries in holding men employes because of the increased wages paid by the latter, the Navy Department has resorted to the employment of women in several of its big manufacturing plants, it became known today. Practically all of the Summer clothing used by the Navy is made by female workers in the large clothing plants in New York and Charleston, S. C., operated under naval control. Inability to procure men in the cartridge bag sewing departments of the ordnance storehouses in New York and other naval centers has brought about the employment of a large force of women. Consideration is now being given the proposition of introducing women labor in many of the Navy-yards and gun factories on work that does not require skilled mechanics.
