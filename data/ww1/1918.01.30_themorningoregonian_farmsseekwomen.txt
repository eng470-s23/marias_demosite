FARMS SEEK WOMEN National Registration Plan Department of Labor. SHORTAGE OF MEN MET Federal Employment Agencies Will Make Every Effort to Provide for Moving Crops of 1918, However Large They May Be. WASHINGTON. Jan. 29. National registration of women available for work on farms is planned by the Department of Labor as one of the advance steps in a campaign to secure a sufficiency of farm labor for every section of the country during the coming season. A. L. Berkman, chief of the division of farm service, announced tonight that every effort would be made to meet the expected shortage of farm labor by a plan to mobilize the available men and women in every community in the country. Heavy snows in the MidWest, he said, should mean a large wheat crop, and if the favorable weather continued one of the biggest yields on record may be expected. A special farm service man will be stationed in most of the 94 Federal employment agencies of the country, Mr. Berkman said, and, in addition, post-offices in the small farming communities will be used as recruiting stations, the postmaster or some other representative citizen acting as community labor agent. he farmers, Mr. Berkman said. "will have to increase wages much more than they have to get men to come from the cities. They have not raised wages anywhere in proportion to their increase in profits." Women, Mr. Berkman continued, will be needed for truck gardening, fruit gathering, dairying and other light forms of labor, but they will not be called upon for the heavy work so long as men are available. The college girls and the women of the leisure classes who are ready to respond to a call for workers as a matter of patriotic service," Mr. Berkman said, "must be depended upon chiefly for the women labor that will be needed."
