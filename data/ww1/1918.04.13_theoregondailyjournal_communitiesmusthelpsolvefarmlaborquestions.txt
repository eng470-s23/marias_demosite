COMMUNITIES MUST HELP SOIVE FARM LABOR QUESTIONS Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Has Issued Statement on Women's Work. Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Clarence Ousley has made public a statement on women's labor on the farm in response to many requests from women all over the country who wish to do farm work. Assistant Secretary Ousley says:  While women can do much in the solution of the complex and rather pressing farm labor problem it should be understood that the man power of the country is not yet exhausted and that except for certain lighter tasks men are better adapted than women for farm labor. While much is being done by the Departments of Agriculture and Labor to mobilise man power for farming operations much yet remains to be done if we are to make sure the saving of the crops which are now being planted. The primary responsibility must be assumed by the regions and communities most vitally affected, because no agency of government can create labor or compel men to pursue any particular vocation. In all towns and cities adjacent to agricultural regions there are many men of farm experience who can be spared for a day at a time or a week at a time, as the case may be, to help the farmers with their most pressing tasks. In releasing the men of farm experience in the cities for farm labor many women can be utilized to take their places for a few days at a time or for a whole season. Generally speaking, it will become more and more necessary for women to take the place of men In all occupations. In addition to relieving men in towns and cities women can actually perform many farm tasks, such as dairying, vegetable cultivation, fruit gathering, etc. The practice method of utilizing women for farm labor cannot be prescribed in any uniform plan, but it will depend upon conditions in the community and upon the farms. Of course, steps must be taken to see that women laborers are properly housed and otherwise are safeguarded from unnecessary hardships.
