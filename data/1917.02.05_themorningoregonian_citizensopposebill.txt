CITIZENS OPPOSE BILL DELEGATION TO GO TO SALEM TO DEFEND TEN-HOUR. LAW. Senator La Follett's Measure Exempting; Cannery Women Employes to Be Fought at Capital. A delegation of prominent Portland men and women will go to Salem this week to protest to the Legislature against the passage of Senator La Follett's bill to permit women and children to work unlimited hours in canneries. At a meeting here Saturday a set of resolutions was adopted expressing disapproval of the La Follett bill which would exempt from the state ten-hour law "females employed in harvesting, packing, curing, canning and drying any perishable fruit or vegetable." At present the hours of women's labor is regulated by the Industrial Welfare Commission, but the La Follett bill would deprive the Commission of authority over women employed in the fruit and vegetable industry.
