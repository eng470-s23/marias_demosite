GOOD CITIZENS, MEN AND WOMEN LABOR ON STATE HIGHWAYS Salem, Or., May 2. Reports and pictures are still being received to show that some real work was done on Good Roads day, and that some real results were obtained. It is felt, however, that the greater and more lasting result will find expression in a future exemplification of the idea of better highways, and what each one can do to that end, this idea having been implanted in the minds of all who participated in, or read about, the activities of "Good Roads" day. Men, women and children, with their teams and outfits, gave a day of labor on state highways. The women, if they did not exert themselves with pick and shovel, did heroic work with skillet and coffee pot.
