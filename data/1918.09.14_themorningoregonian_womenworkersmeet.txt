WOMEN WORKERS MEET Plans for Liberty Loan Campaign Are Discussed. Mrs. Emma I. Holmes, chairman of the fourth liberty loan committee of the women's labor unions of Portland, met with women of the clerks', waitresses', telephone operators', garment-workers' and laundry-workers' unions in the Central Library last night to discuss plans for the coming drive. Union women will obtain pledges among their own members and turn them in to the committee at headquarters. Only a small representation of union women appeared at the meeting, and Mrs. Holmes has called a meeting for Monday night in the Library to assemble all representatives for a final conference.
