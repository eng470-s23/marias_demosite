The Soldier, the Land, the Job Medford. Or., Jan. 1. To the Editor of The Journal Everyone seems determined to put the soldiers returning to their comfortable homes out on logged off lands, or on irrigation units, on some far off desert homestead. One would think the returning man at arms of the present day was the genus hobo. Why not consult him? Every man anyone knows anything about has a home and either a place in school or a job awaiting him the identical job he left to perform the duty he was born to. The women are not going to crowd him out not at all. That is not the way of women. When there is any crowding, I have noticed, it is not the man who gets shoved out. Solicitude for our returning heroes is good, but it can be run into the ground, and these logged off and irrigation propositions look like that, precisely. Has young America changed his nature, that he must be penalized to life servitude on logged off lands, now that he is on the way home? Before the war you could not have given him all the logged off land in the state, if he had been required to reside thereon in person. Is he any different now? Why not let Hero alone? Let him return to his vine, fig tree and job, and let the other fellow, who took his place, return to the looking out for a job stunt? JUNIUS.
