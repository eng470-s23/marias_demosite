NEW YORK DISTRICTS CHANGE; REALTY VALUES DROP OFF MILLIONS IN A YEAR Other statements in regard to the Standard of living in New York were: That there are thousands of women workers in New York who are living on $4, $5 and $6 a week, when $8 is the lowest income on which any woman should be expected to support herself. That one-third of the workingmen's families in New York do not have means to purchase sufficient food, clothing, shelter and other necessaries, and that this one-third and an additional one-sixth, or one-half altogether, cannot save for the time when support is cut off by the death, incapacitation or forced unemployment of the breadwinner. Many other things besides the income influence the standard or manner of living, the speaker said, the most important of them being cost of living. Prices in New York have soared 25 percent in the last 10 years, whereas the income has not advanced proportionately. Remedies for these conditions were put forth as: Adequate pay, the cheapening of amusements and the betterment of educational facilities, such as night schools, gymnasiums and clubs; improvement of conditions under which men and women labor, and the abolishment of the harmful forms of child labor; the Improvement of dwelling places, notably tenements, the training of mothers and housewives, the guiding of children along paths of strength, self-reliance and self-respect, and the regulation of prices.
