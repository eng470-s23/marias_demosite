The chamber of commerce in Hazleton, Pa., has formulated a plan to furnish women labor for the farmers in that territory during the coming spring and summer. The workers will be furnished at $15 a week or $50 per month, provided each rural farm owner will take a minimum of 10 for not less than a month.
