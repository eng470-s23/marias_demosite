Spencer Plant To Increase Lebanon, March 17 With the announcement from the Spencer Packing company that approximately 450 women, an in crease of about 100 will be required to work in the Lebanon cannery and the new dehydration plant, which is to be operated the first time this summer a request has been issued by the U. S. employment office asking all women who will be available for employment to register at the office on Second street as soon as possible. The dehydration plant, formerly a fruit dryer located at the north end of Walnut street, will employ about 100 women on a two-shift basis and will continue in operation over a 10 month period, according to C. B. Spencer, owner. Because of the expected labor shortage this summer an effort is being made at this time to establish a pool of women labor. All employment will be made through the local employment office.
