Investigate Hours of Woman's Work Millie Trumball, secretary of the slate industrial welfare commission, was here yesterday checking up the hours and wages for women and girls employed in this city. She states that the commission is waging a campaign to enforce the state laws regulating the hours for women's labor and the wages which must be paid and that number of convictions have been secured, while many cases are pending. She states that there is a great amount of violation of the state law in this regard, mostly resulting from ignorance regarding the law on the subject.
