Cannery Crews Get Pay Jump San Francisco, April 1 (AP) Final approval of wage increases for 70,000 AFL cannery workers in the fruit and vegetable industry of northern California was announced Wednesday through the office of war information. The OWI said a previous war labor board approval of an agreement between the California State Council of Cannery Workers (AFL) and the California Processors and Growers association had been ratified by James F. Byrnes, director of the economic stabilization committee. Approval of the stabilization committee was essential in this case because the canners had stipulated that price increases would be needed if wages were boosted. The OWI said the agreement boosted the present minimum hourly scale for men (73 cents to $1.05) to tops ranging from 85 cents to $1.15. Women laborers' wages were increased from 60 to 70 cents an hour, and women floor inspectors' from 70 to 85 cents.
