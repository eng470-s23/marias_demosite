Russian Women Busy Behind Lines By M. S. Handler (United Press Staff Correspondent) Kuibyshev, July 2 (U.P.) One of the most moving sights of this war is the sturdy peasant women of the Volga valley, white kerchiefs about their heads and in gaily colored blouses and skirts, carrying big packing cases on their backs from river docks to steamship decks. They are only a segment of the huge mass of soviet women who are making sacrifices to repel the German Invader. These Russian women undoubtedly will go down in history as heroines. They are setting the pace in every conceivable noncombatant activity. I found it difficult to comprehend, even when I saw it myself, that women are to be found stoking locomotives, managing and operating the Volga's innumerable oil refueling barges serving as ships officers, deck hands and stevedores. They use a novel harness to aid them in lifting and carrying the huge packing cases. I've seen them, in a crew including some male deckhands, labor for six hours with only brief rest intervals. In no case did the women permit the men to outwork them.  It is a common sight in the Volga valley to see women driving horse and camel carts laden with grain. These they load and unload themselves. Russian men are earning a new respect for their women and all along my trip up and down the Volga I never heard a man speak a grumbling word to the women officers, sailors, came in contact. They carry out without complaining a vast anonymous enterprise which they consider neither unusual nor exceptional. The women stevedores are constantly joking and take pride in their physical prowess. Seeing these women laborers, there appears no doubt that should the day arrive when they are needed on the front line, Russia would suffer no shortage of women eager and capable of moving into the battle as fighting units.
