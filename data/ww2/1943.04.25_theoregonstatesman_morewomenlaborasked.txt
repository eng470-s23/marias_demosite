More Women Labor Asked "The ladies, bless them, what would we do without them?" was
the sentiment uttered by Joseph Wilson, US employment agriculture placement officer, Saturday as he issued a call for a few more women to work in the hop fields. The workers are needed Monday morning; the job is hop training; the pay, 65 cents per hour. Trucks will pick up women at the employment office at 7:30 a.m. daily, Wilson stated.
