WOMEN FORCED TO  DO WORK OF MEN  Conditions in New York State Inhuman, Declares Senator Wagner. (United Press Leased Wire.) New York, Sept. 2S. Due to the findings of the state factory Investigating committee that body Is to demand from The legislature the wiping out of many of the awful conditions under which women labor in the Empire state. "Conditions under which women have to work here are Inhuman beyond belief," declared Senator Robert V. Wagner of the investigating committee today. "The women in the slaughter houses in Buffalo, in the ore foundries in Utica and in the harvester twine plant at Auburn are especially to be pitied. In the, slaughter houses they are forced to work on wet floors with no protection for their feet. In Utica and Auburn they are subjected to intolerable sanitary conditions. All of these women have to do men's labor. I look for the general establishment of these investigating commissions."
