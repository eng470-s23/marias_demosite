Women Replace Aliens, Run London Hotels and Clubs (By United Press.) LONDON, Dec. 27. (By Mail.) There is one branch of service which  is going to make a big call on woman labor.  Hitherto one of the least exploited fields of service for women is in ho tels and clubs. Before the war this  field was monopolized by aliens, but many of them will never be permitted  to return to it, and it is certain that, hotel and club managers will avail  themselves gladly of women's labor  to meet the demand of their repleted staffs.  Even in the most conservative clubs women have replaced men so successfully during the war there is little doubt that their services will be retained, as waitresses, bookkeepers and interpreters. Several hotels have been managed entirely bv women during the war, and patrons of the hotels have declared  that they never received better service. Running a hotel is very much like running a household on a large scale,  and so women here find themselves  in a proper setting. This field will  embrace many types and many classes  of women. There are positions ranging from scullery maid to manager.
