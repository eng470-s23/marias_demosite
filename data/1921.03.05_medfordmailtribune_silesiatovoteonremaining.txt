SILESIA TO VOTE ON REMAINING A PART OF GERMANY RYBNIK, Upper Silesia, Mar. Women laborers in mines and factories and on railroads are more numerous than men in several districts of the coal region here. Girls and boys of ten and 12 years are regularly employed, digging ditches, ballasting run-ways, pushing trucks and doing other heavy work which before the war was done only by men. This is the territory hitherto a part of Germany, but claimed now by Poland. A plebiscite, or vote of the people, soon will be held under the terms of the peace treaty of Versailles to determine whether Upper Silesia will remain German or become a part of Poland.  The German mine owners say shortage of labor and post-war economic conditions have forced women and children into this toil, which under German administration was forbidden. There is also a shortage of manpower because of the great number of soldiers from here who were killed in the war. The women engaged in the heavy work generally are Poles, distinguished by the bright shawl-like headdress, which they affect. Some of them have adopted a modification of man's apparel as better suited to their work. The correspondent saw three women of two score or more who constituted a "section gang," wearing heavy trousers under their short skirts. The majority of the women wear heavy shoes with thick wooden soles and cloth tops, all home-made. Some have heavy boots, which apparently were once the property of German soldiers.
