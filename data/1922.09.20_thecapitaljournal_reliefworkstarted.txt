Relief Work Started.  "We started the work of relief immediately. The American firms Contributed the use of their automobiles and trucks. They never saw them again, because they were completely burned up. Representative Americans, members of the Y. M. C. A., and professors of the American college, organized a central committee. Within an hour, while the automobiles were still in their possession with the Star and Stripes flying on their machines, they were all over the city administering relief. Their first effort was amongst Americans. The conduct was generous  and heroic, even under the greatest difficulties. We urged American women teachers in the girl's school of the Y. W. C. A. to leave Smyrna but they refused until driven by the flames. "These brave women labored unceasingly without food and  sleep. Some are still there."
