One Who Knows Tells of a  Day in a Silverton Hopyard By this time the yard had begun to wake up. Already the wire-man had let down several wires. Other workers had come and several had begun to pick. The men were in khaki trousers and over-alls; the majority of the women were dressed likewise. But there are certain characteristics that mark a woman hop picker from all other women laborers. There are the stockings, with the feet cut off, that cover the arms and wrists; the canvas gloves with their leather patches to protect the hands; the large handkerchief to prevent the throat from becoming scratched. large, light straw hat, made to fit the head by means of a shoestring drawn through at the base of the crown, covers the head. A safety pin, worn in the manner of a fraternity pin, to hold the hop checks, completes the costume. Over the front of the men's and women's clothing are. dirty brows stains.
