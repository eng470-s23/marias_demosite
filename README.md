## Project-level Basic Information - Introduction 

1. Project Name: Changing Attitudes Towards Womenâ€™s Labor: How Newspapers Reflect Popular Ideologies
2. Dataset file name(s) and extension(s): Data was filed using the naming convention: "year.month.day_newspapername_articlename" as .txt files. 
3. Project description/abstract/keywords: For this project, I transcribed and analyzed historical newspapers to assess changes in attitudes towards women's participation in the workforce in Oregon between 1910 and 1975, in relation to the world wars. (women, labor, World War 1, World War 2, Oregon)
4. Authors and collaborators, including ORCID IDs and contact information: Maria Shimota 
5. Dates of Data Collection (YYYYMMDD format): 20230519-20230605 
6. Date of file creation and updates, and nature of those updates (YYYYMMDD format): I added files every day for about three weeks between 20230519 and 20230605, and on 20230608, these files were categorized and combined based on category.

4. I completed a [fair use evaluation](https://github.com/eng470-s23/marias_demosite/blob/main/fairuse/Fair%20Use%20Evaluation%20Documentation.pdf) for this project. 

## Methodological and Data-specific Information
1. Description of methods for data collection and processing: I used a keyword search 'women labor' to find newspaper articles to use for this project. I saved these as plain text files, and went through each article to make sure that they were accurate and fix any wrong transcriptions using the program 'Text Edit'. I removed any parts of these newspapers from the plain text files so that I would only have articles or parts of articles that were relevant to my project, the edited versions were then saved onto my computer.
2. One thing worth noting about my data collection was that beginning around 1923 or 1924, there were way fewer newspapers available through the site, most likely due to copyright (as all before 1923 are in the public domain). 

## Credits and Acknowledgments

The creation of this project could not have happened without the direct and indirect support of many different people; first off, the University of Oregon's History subject librarian, Kevin McDowell, who assisted me in my research, and played a large role in the Historical Oregon Newspapers site, which has been the basis of this project. Professor Mattie Burkert has helped me along every step of this project and I would not have been able to do it without her help. Professor Steven Beda, because it was because of his class that I came up with the idea for this project. My friend Lilly Smith, a fellow Digital Humanities student, who has helped talk through this project with me, and assisted me when I run into trouble. And last but not least, my best friend and roommate, Grace Meyer. 

I would like to acknowledge that due to the nature of the resources used in this project, as primary historic sources, some of them contain misogynistic or racist rhetoric, and I used some of these sources in this project as I am analyzing historic texts, and this may be harmful to some 
audiences. I don't like reading or using these materials, but I do not want to erase these aspects of history or pretend that these things didn't happen or didn't exist. 

This project centers around labor, and I feel that it is important to acknowledge the exploitation of labor within the creation of technology, and thus this project. Large companies like [Apple](https://www.firstpost.com/world/apple-accused-of-using-child-labour-to-mine-cobalt-promises-to-switch-to-100-recycled-cobalt-by-2025-12453322.html), for example, have been outsourcing dangerous labor, like mining cobalt, to other countries, where people - including children, are being paid pennies. Many of these workers experience cancer, injuries, or death doing this work. 

As a student at the University of Oregon, and someone living in Eugene, I acknowledge that I inhabit land that did, and should still, belong to the Kalapuya people. One can support the Grande Ronde's Tribal Sovereignty by [adding their name](https://www.grandronde.org/history-culture/history/removing-the-consent-decree/) to a list of those who support the passage of legislation that would review and modernize the hunting and fishing rights of the Confederated Tribes of the Grande Ronde.
