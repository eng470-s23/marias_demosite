# README for demo-site

This repository is a demo for ENG 470/570 students to clone in order to create individual project workspaces. It contains templates for all required components of the final portfolio, written in markdown. (Recommended markdown editor: [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/)). 

- **[readme.md](readme.md) (this file)**: a template to record project-level metadata, taken from [UO Libraries' research guide to Doing Digital Projects in the Open](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/doingdigitalprojectsintheopen/workshop2). To customize it, delete this header section up to the horizontal line (---).
- **[license.md](license.md)**: the license defining how others can reuse your data and other content in your repository.
- **[project-log.md](project-log.md)**: a weekly log for tracking your research notes and progress. This is also where your pitch, draft annotated bibliography, and draft environmental scan go. Revised versions of those materials will likely appear in your white paper.
- **[data-management.md](data-management-plan.md)**: your data management plan, explaining how your project files are stored, named, published, and protected. 
- **[presentation.md](presentation.md)**: visual aids for your presentation at our class symposium in week 9. You may choose instead to use PowerPoint, in which case this file will be presentation.ppt or presentation.pptx.
- **[white-paper.md](white-paper.md)**: final write-up of your project and lessons learned from conceptualizing and prototyping a researched digital humanities project. Your white paper will also contain, embed, or link to the project prototype itself.
- **[_config.yml](_config.yml)**: the file that provides basic styling info to turn your repo into a static website. 
- **[index.md](index.md)**: the front page of your website, which can link to or aggregate any other parts of your repo using relative links.

## Credits and Acknowledgments

The creation of this project could not have happened without the direct and indirect support of many different people; first off, the University of Oregon's History subject librarian, Kevin McDowell, who assisted me in my research, and played a large role in the Historical Oregon Newspapers site, which has been the basis of this project. Professor Mattie Burkert has helped me along every step of this project and I would not have been able to do it without her help. Professor Steven Beda, because it was because of his class that I came up with the idea for this project. My friend Lilly Smith, a fellow Digital Humanities student, who has helped talk through this project with me, and assisted me when I run into trouble. And last but not least, my best friend and roommate, Grace Meyer. 

I would like to acknowledge that due to the nature of the resources used in this project, as primary historic sources, some of them contain misogynistic or racist rhetoric, and I used some of these sources in this project as I am analyzing historic texts, and this may be harmful to some 
audiences. I don't like reading or using these materials, but I do not want to erase these aspects of history or pretend that these things didn't happen or didn't exist. 

This project centers around labor, and I feel that it is important to acknowledge the exploitation of labor within the creation of technology, and thus this project. Large companies like [Apple](https://www.firstpost.com/world/apple-accused-of-using-child-labour-to-mine-cobalt-promises-to-switch-to-100-recycled-cobalt-by-2025-12453322.html), for example, have been outsourcing dangerous labor, like mining cobalt, to other countries, where people - including children, are being paid pennies. Many of these working experience cancer, injuries, or death doing this work. 

As a student at the University of Oregon, and someone living in Eugene, I acknowledge that I inhabit land that did, and should still, belong to the Kalapuya people. One can support the Grande Ronde's Tribal Sovereignty by [adding their name](https://www.grandronde.org/history-culture/history/removing-the-consent-decree/) to a list of those who support the passage of legislation which would review and modernize the hunting and fishing rights of the Confederated Tribes of the Grande Ronde.
