## pitch
- My research topic is: women's labor activism in Oregon after WW2 

- My research question is: How did WW2 impact women's attitudes towards labor and their roles within the workforce?

- I expect to work with the following *materials*: I plan to work with both secondary and primary sources during this project. I have found some articles already on this topic as well as some data about labor during the 20th century and photos that I have requested and will look at most likely next week. 

- I plan to *process* these materials by: I need to read through and take notes on these materials to get more knowledge and background for this project. I think if this data applies, I will need to assess what sort of data I have (I requested a few different sources and am not certain which will apply) and then based on what data works, process it in ways that work. I also hope that I will be able to find some relevant photos, I requested a book that has photos in it, but those photos will need to be scanned or I will take photos of them so that they can be used digitally. 

- I plan to *present* these materials by: I would like to have an information section and different areas with written information, and I would like to use maps, graphs, and photos in this project. 

- My final submission will take this form: I would like to submit my project in the form of a website, I'd like to highlight a few important people/groups with info about them, have a space with archives for primary sources, and then potentially include a maps with important spaces or numerical data/graphs about participants in the workforce and how things changed over time. I would also like it to have photos. 

- This project is intended to engage these audiences and communities: I think that the intended audience for this project is labor historians and scholars, and I would also like students (both undergrad and graduate) who may not be from Oregon but live here for school to be able to learn about the labor history of Oregon. I think a lot of students and GE's deal with difficult situations with jobs both through the school and outside of school and I would like to show them the rich history of activism here to encourage them to not accept unfair treatment. 

- I bring the following existing knowledge and/or skills to the project: I already have background and experience with research, so I feel confident in my ability to find sources and important information and feel comfortable with the research process itself and the potential issues or problems that come with research. 

- In order to do this project, I need to learn: I think I need to learn more about making a website. I feel like when I have tried in the past i can't always get it to look the way that I want it to so I would like to learn more about customizing the site to look the way I want. I think I also need to learn more about processing research and presenting it in a way that isn't a research paper, and digitizing paper documents/photos.

# week 4 
## notes
- I think I'm sort of changing directions - women's work in industrial fields during WW2 (ex shipyards which was a dominant industry in Portland) and how that influenced and informed women's labor activism in Oregon 

## search log

for most of my searches, through both the library and JSTOR, I was able to find a lot of sources through key words without having to narrow down the searches a lot. Many of my sources came from a search of like "women labor WW2 oregon" or just "oregon labor ww2" - sorry I didnt really write it down :(

Source 1, 2 3: 
  library search "Oregon Historical Quarterly" -> JSTOR - search "women labor" 

Source 4: 
  book I own (sorry :/)

Source 5:
  archives west: search "women shipyard world war 2" -> Northwest Women's History Project records and interviews, 1943-2021 -> scroll down, under 'content description' click on 'available online in OHS Digital Collections' link 
  
Source 6:
  I don't remember and didn't write it down :( sorry I keep trying to replicate the search and can't figure out how I got there

Source 7: 
  go to Oregon Encyclopedia -> search "shipyard" find 'Kaiser Shipyards'
  
Source 8: (these are the newspapers I'm using for my project): 
  go to the UO library search homepage -> click on "research support" and go to research guides -> journalism & communication -> finding newspaper resources -> stay on newspaper resources, scroll down, click on "Using the Historic Oregon Newspapers Website" -> click on "Historic Oregon Newspapers" -> search "women labor" and filter by year :)

# week 5
## notes
- How did the experiences of different groups of women workingf in shipyards in Portland during WW2 change based on their race/age? (indigenous women, black women, elderly women) 

## research question
- How did the experiences of different groups of women workingf in shipyards in Portland during WW2 change based on their race/age? (indigenous women, black women, elderly women) 
- changing directions again: How do Oregon Historical newspapers reflect changing attitudes towards womens labor in Oregon from 1910-1970?

## annotated bibliography

- I think at this stage I'm using them for internal information, but I would like to use these in portfolio eventually, I just think they need to be polished a little before I can publish them. I made them with the idea that it would just be me seeing them but I would like to publish them eventually.

- summary: Mercier's article mainly discusses women's labor activism during the post war period through the 70s. She discusses the unique conditions of labor in Oregon, the purposeful exclusion of women of color from unions, the necessity for childcare for workers, and the ways in which white women attempted to portray themselves as workers rather than women in attempts to fight for higher wages and better working conditions alongside men. Another thing that Mercier discusses is key figures in the women's labor movement, as well as key events. This article discusses the ideology and viewpoint of white female activists, as well as those around them - including male activists and union members, and larger groups of people in the area. 

- potential use for project: For my project, I have begun to move more in the direction of women's industrial labor during World War 2 and how it impacted the labor movement in Oregon. I think I will use this source to help aid my description of the labor movement during the post war period, the ideology and views of white women during this period, and use it to provide background and context for other sources.

- indication of general utility of source: I think that this source is beneficial to inform the broader public of the labor movement during the post war period (ww2) and the ideology and views of white women during this period; I think the main use of this source is to provide background knowledge.

- citation: Amy E. Platt. “‘Go into the Yard as a Worker, Not as a Woman’: Oregon Women During World War II, a Digital Exhibit on the Oregon History Project.” Oregon Historical Quarterly, vol. 116, no. 2, 2015, pp. 234–48. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.5403/oregonhistq.116.2.0234. Accessed 20 Apr. 2023.

- summary: Platt's writing details the experiences and specifics of women who entered different areas of the workforce, especially  related to war-production. She uses numbers and percentages to provide a picture of the workforce in Oregon, and goes into depth about the experiences of black women in the shipyards in Portland. She goes into post war conditions in Oregon for women as men came back from war, and Platt mentions more in depth the post war experience of women of color in Oregon - particularly Black and Japanese American women. She then gives pages to a few different women who worked during the war and goes in depth about what they did and their experience. In the midst of these individual shoutouts, she provides a page of information about Indigenous women in Oregon who worked in the shipyards.

- potential use for project: I think because Platt uses some statistics in this article, particularly in regards to numbers of women working in industrial fields in Oregon and the numbers of women in the work force during this period - I would like to use those specifics in my project. Platt also wrote a profile of a female welder who worked in the shipyards, and wrote about Indiegnous women working in the shipyards, and I would like to use the information from both of these pages in my project (not sure how yet). I really like that Platt provided information about women of color and their experiences and I would also like to do the same. 
- indication of general utility of source: Platt's article provides specific numbers, particularly in regards to numbers of women working industrial fields in Oregon and the numbers of women in the work force during this period, which could be useful for different projects. Platt also provides profiles and experiences of specific women, and discusses the experience of women of color which could be useful to provide further background information, or one could use these specifics in a project.

- citation: Diane Simmons. “Rejection, Reception, and Rejection Again: Women in Oregon’s World War II Shipyards.” Oregon Historical Quarterly, vol. 119, no. 1, 2018, pp. 96–119. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.5403/oregonhistq.119.1.0096. Accessed 27 Apr. 2023.

- summary: Simmons begins her discussion of women's labor in the shipyards with the mention of Rosie the Riveter, both the original poster and the version created by Norman Rockwell. Simmons then moves on to discuss the viewpoint that many people, men in particular, around Oregon had of women doing industrial labor, particularly working in the shipyards, and how these ideals influenced newspapers and propaganda posters, such as both of these versions of Rosie the Riveter. She then discusses the experience of white and black women working in the shipyards, and their experiences working alongside men. She then moves on to discuss Eva Eldridge, who Simmons knew, and Eva's experience working in the shipyards. 

- potential use for project: Something that Simmons mentioned in the article was in regards to a childcare facility built by Kaiser to take care of the children of the women who were working in his shipyards. They were absent more often than men because of childcare, so Kaiser built a childcare center which I would like to talk about in my project. I think childcare was, and continues to be, a huge barrier for women's ability to work.

# week 6
## notes
- based on the Orgeon historical newspapers, how did attitudes towards women's labor in Oregon change over time, as revealed in newspapers?

## annotated bibliography, continued

### source 4 annotation
- citation: Polishuk, Sandy. *Sticking to the Union: An Oral History of the Life and Times of Julia Ruuttila.* Palgrave Macmillan, 2003.  

- summary: Polishuk's book is a biography of the life of lifelong labor activist Julia Ruuttila, and her work in Oregon as a labor activist. It discusses her life growing up in Eugene with a father in the IWW, her life after moving out of her parents house, her relationships, and most importantly: her work. As this book was written after Polishuk interviewed Julia, the people around her, and researched into her life, there are a few inconsistencies within the story, but mainly surrounding personal details. Julia was extremely dedicated to her work, and this book is a wonderful way to learn more about what she has done for labor rights in Oregon.

- potential use for project: Although originally I wanted to make a subsection of my project about Julia and use this book to inform that section, I have since switched gears. I think that I will use this book to inform my project detailing attitudes towards working women. The involevement of women in unions, and in the work force changed over time and is reflected in this book and I would like to use this book as background information.

### source 5 annotation
- citation: Northwest Women's History Project . “Northwest Women's History Project Records and Interviews.” 2021, digitalcollections.ohs.org/coll-883-northwest-womens-history-project-records-and-interviews. Accessed 28 Apr. 2023.  

- summary: I listened to the oral interviews of three different women who had worked different jobs in Portland at the shipyards during WW2, the first was Alice Erickson, the second was Dorothy Anderson, and the last was Velma Lake. Alice worked as a driller, Dorothy did both inventory work and worked as an electrician's apprentice, and Velma worked as a scaler (assisted painters), a painter, and a welder. All of these women had different stories to tell about their experience in the shipyards and with the unions, and what they did after the war. One of the things that I noted from their stories was that they needed to join unions to work in the shipyards, but many of the unions were reluctant to take on women because they were going to rid of them after the war, but took them on out of necessity. Another important point was that these women doubted themselves prior to working in the yards, but the yards gave them confidence. 
 
- potential use for project: I think that from these interviews, I can tell the sort of jobs women were doing before and after the war (office work or secretarial work mostly), and even though they had experience working in industrial fields, they never would have hoped to get a job doing those things following the war. I think this provides context for me to see how women's work in trades was treated, and the roles that women were limited to working in. I think that these interviews also helped me to see how these women viewed themselves and their roles: for example, them having doubts about their capabilities prior to working in the yards, and them knowing that they'd be let go after the war.

### source 6 annotation
- citation: source #6: Oregon History Project. “Women in the Shipyards.” *Oregon, WWII, Women, and Work,* Oregon Historical Society, www.oregonhistoryproject.org/women-in-the-shipyards/.

- summary: This source provides background information about the necessity of female workers during World War 2, and includes some insight into attitudes towards working women during the war. It also includes a small glimpse into postwar work life for women. This source is not very long, but also provides a little bit of information about women joining unions during the war because they anticapted layoffs following the end of the war as men wanted to return to their jobs. 
 
- potential use for project: I think that this source is beneficial to provide background information, but much of the information from this source can be found in other sources. I think one of the most useful things about this source is that it serves as a portal of sorts; many other sources about similar topics can be found at the bottom of this page and are linked, with small passages to show the reader what those sources are about. 

- indication of general utility: 

### source 7 annotation
- citation: source #7: Oliver, Gordon. “Kaiser Shipyards.” *The Oregon Encyclopedia,* Oregon Historical Society , www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/kaiser_shipyards/#.ZEwxeezMLs1.

- summary: This page written by Gordon provides insight into the shipyards themselves, including their functions, numbers of employees, and different information about production. It also helps the reader understand the social and economic impact of the shipyards on Portland during the war. One of the ways it does this is to provide statistics about women, and people of color moving to Portland to work in shipyards and provides numerical data about this. 

- potential use for project: I think that this is useful because it helped me to understand just how many people moved to Portland for work. There was a desperate need for industrial workers in Portland during the war, and this didn't allow shipyards and other places of work to be picky about who they hired. I think that at least for a few years, for the duration of the war, what newspapers have to say about working women will be different from before and after the war.

## environmental scan
*The environmental scan situates your project within the existing scholarly research and articulates its contribution. Answer each of the following questions in about one well-developed paragraph. You may use bulleted lists to organize your thoughts, but please write in complete sentences.*

### contribution
*Describe what you will do and why. What is unique about your project and what you will be contributing to your scholarly community? What problem will be resolved, what question will be answered, or what opportunity will be created through your project?*

- For this project I will analyze historic Oregon newspapers as a way to reveal changing ideals surrounding women's participation in the work force. I originally was interested in women's labor activism and the history of unions in Oregon, but struggled finding a gap in the research for my project. I am really interested in the history of Oregon, and I like learning about women's participation in history. I will analyze historic newspapers as a way to reveal changing attitudes, and I would like to present this analysis and create a digital exhibit with note worthy papers. My project is unqiue because I will be analyzing newspapers as a source that demonstrate popular opinions. I think there are projects that discuss changing ideals about women's participation in the labor force, but none analyze historic newspapers. I think this project will not only answer my original question about how changing ideals are reflected in newspapers, but I hope to also answer questions about how newspapers reflect popular attitudes, speak to the general public, and potentially influence the opinions of others. 

### methods
*What tools and methods will you use, and why are those the best technologies for your purposes?*

- The tools that will be used for this project are "textEdit" and "Voyant". TextEdit is a program one can download onto their computer, and can be used for many different types of projects. I will use this program to clean up the newspapers I am looking at, by fixing any mistakes and removing irrelevant sections, and storing and formatting these documents in an organized way that will make it easy to upload them to Voyant. I will use Voyant to analyze these texts and reveal patterns, as well as changing ideals. I think that these are the best technologies for this project because both are free and capable of doing what I need for this project, and are compatible with my computer. I believe that paying for any program that does these same functions is unneccessary and a waste of money, as both of these programs do what I need them to.

### stakeholders / audiences
*Who is invested in the final products? How can you reach that audience and meet the needs of interested parties and stakeholders?*

- This project is intented for academics, such as both professors and students, specifically those interested in history, women and gender studies, or labor history. The majority of my sources are available through the UO, so the UO is also part of my intended audience: I would like to show the UO how people are using the resources that they have made available, and encourage them to continue providing these sources and other resources that may otherwise be difficult to access. I think in order to reach this audience it would be beneficial if I posted about it publicly for others to see. 

### dependencies and resources

- My entire project depends on the newspapers accessed through the UO library, and many of these sources are only available through the UO. These newspapers have been uploaded to "Oregon Historic Newspapers" which is a site created by the UO. I will use the program "textEdit", which was free, but I had to download onto my computer in order to use. To sort through and upload these texts, I will require at least 6 hours, most likely over the course of a few days, and I will need enough data on my computer to store and download all of the newspapers that I will use in this project. I will use Voyant to analyse these newspapers, which is a free and available website that anyone can use.

## notes
- currently text mining and transcribing news papers, as these text files will be inserted into Voyant, I thought it would make sense to use current and use one version of each word, changes made as follows: 
    - per cent -> percent
    - tokether -> together  
    - statees -> states
    - thru -> through
    - middle west -> midwest
    - asociation -> association

    - ocupation -> occupation
    - criticises -> criticizes 
    - seceretary -> secretary 
    - them selves -> themselves
