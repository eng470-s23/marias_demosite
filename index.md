Using textual analysis programs like Voyant, which are meant to analyze literature, for the analysis of newspapers made it difficult to demonstrate full pictures of the information that I saw in these articles, and hoped to convey in this site. To be able to use Voyant, we ended up categorizing the data I had collected into: [pre-ww1](/preww1), [ww1](/ww1), [inter-war period between ww1 and ww2](/interwar), [ww2](/ww2), and [post ww2](/postwar), I merged the files that were categorized in each period into one file to make it easier to process in Voyant, which were filed as a [periodized data set](/periodized). Both world wars dramatically changed the work force

### How did the way that women were talked about change?

One of the ways that I tracked the way that women were talked about, was by examining the usage of 'girls' as a term when being used to discuss adult women. While this term isn't offensive, when adult women are referred to as 'girls' it's often meant in a condescending way, and is meant to undermine the intelligence, experience, and maturity that women have. The articles I processed revealed that the usage of 'girl' or 'girls' in reference to adult women peaked during the interwar period, and after closer examination, revealed that this was most commonly used at the end of 1918, after the end of ww1.

### How did the necessity for women's labor vary during both wars?

Due to an urgent need for workers during both wars, there were increased discussions around women's employment:

During ww1, the biggest industries that required women's work were agricultural work & factory work:

Oregon was a completely different place during ww2 than it had been during ww1, due to increased industrialization, thus changing the field in which women were needed to work to reflect changing industries:

### How about discussion of wages, hours, and working conditions?

Although the graph is a little hard to read, the mentions of wages increased during ww1 and ww2, while the mentions of hours and conditions both decrease during the wars. In the papers I looked at, they talked a ton about the necessity of increased wages during the wars to convince women to work in the fields that men were abandoning (industrial work, farms, factories, etc.). The mentions of the time one had to work and the conditions one worked under decreased. It was 'patriotic' for women to join the work force to support the country, but during times of war, the conditions under which women in the US were working wasn't a huge topic.

### How about women's participance in unions?

During WW2, the mention of unions in relation to women's labor drops to none. In Portland during the war, women were doing a bunch of industrial work and were joining unions, but many didn't want to take women in because they knew they'd want to let them go at the end of the war. There were fewer newspapers from ww2 in the collection I examined, thus there were smaller chances for unions to be mentioned, but the lack of discussion around unions during this period wasn't a coincidence.
