Using textual analysis programs like Voyant, which are meant to analyze literature, for the analysis of newspapers made it difficult to demonstrate full pictures of the information that I saw in these articles, and hoped to convey in this site. To be able to use Voyant, we ended up categorizing the data I had collected into: [pre-ww1](/preww1), [ww1](/ww1), [inter-war period between ww1 and ww2](/interwar), [ww2](/ww2), and [post ww2](/postwar), I merged the files that were categorized in each period into one file to make it easier to process in Voyant, which were filed as a [periodized data set](/periodized). Both world wars dramatically changed the work force

### How did the necessity for women's labor vary during both wars?

necessity for women to participate in farm work & work in factories during ww1:

### How about discussion of wages, hours, and working conditions?

### How about women's participance in unions?

During WW2, the mention of unions in relation to women's labor drops to none. In Portland during the war, women were doing a bunch of industrial work and were joining unions, but many didn't want to take women in because they knew they'd want to let them go at the end of the war. Based on the lack of mentions of union in newspapers alongside women's labor, one can infer that they weren't mentioned during this period for a reason, possibly because they didn't want to remind the hoards of women joining the work force to join them. <img width="463" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-08 at 10 54 48 PM" src="https://github.com/eng470-s23/marias_demosite/assets/129902716/ef6f974f-9c1a-482b-a1e7-05a702a18773">
