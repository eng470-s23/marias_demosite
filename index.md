Using textual analysis programs like Voyant, which are meant to analyze literature, for the analysis of newspapers made it difficult to demonstrate full pictures of the information that I saw in these articles, and hoped to convey in this site. To be able to use Voyant, we ended up categorizing the data I had collected into: [pre-ww1](/preww1), [ww1](/ww1), [inter-war period between ww1 and ww2](/interwar), [ww2](/ww2), and [post ww2](/postwar), I merged the files that were categorized in each period into one file to make it easier to process in Voyant, which were filed as a [periodized data set](/periodized).
