Using textual analysis programs like Voyant, which are meant to analyze literature, for the analysis of newspapers made it difficult to demonstrate full pictures of the information that I saw in these articles, and hoped to convey in this site. To be able to use Voyant, we ended up categorizing the data I had collected into: [pre-ww1](/preww1), [ww1](/ww1), [inter-war period between ww1 and ww2](/interwar), [ww2](/ww2), and [post ww2](/postwar), I merged the files that were categorized in each period into one file to make it easier to process in Voyant, which were filed as a [periodized data set](/periodized). Both world wars dramatically changed the work force

### How did the necessity for women's labor vary during both wars?

discussion of women's employment increased:

### How about discussion of wages, hours, and working conditions?

This graph is a little hard to read, but the mentions of wages increase during ww1 and ww2, while the mentions of hours and conditions both decrease during the wars. In the papers I looked at, they talked a ton about the necessity of increased wages during the wars to convince women to work in the fields that men were abandoning (industrial work, farms). The mentions of the time one has to work and the conditions one worked under decreased. patriotic wo
